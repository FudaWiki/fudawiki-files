Mekurifuda [めくり札], or Mekuri Karuta [めくりかるた], are a type of Japanese playing cards that were directly derived from Tensho Karuta [天正かるた], which were faithful copies of Portuguese playing cards (Nanban Karuta [南蛮カルタ]).

There were many different Mekurifuda patterns depending on the region of Japan, but all of them consisted of 48 cards, and were structurally the same as a Portuguese playing card deck.

The name comes from the game [Mekuri](/en/mekurifuda/games/mekuri), which was originally played using Tensho Karuta. However, these cards are not strictly used for Mekuri games only.

[One-suited Mekurifuda decks](/en/one-suited-mekurifuda-variants) were subsequently developed, which were designed for simpler betting games.

Eventually these card decks would be banned due to their association with gambling, so the gamblers turned to other kinds of cards such as [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) so they could play gambling games.

For a list of games played using these cards, see [Mekurifuda Games](/en/mekurifuda/games).

# History
Sometime during the Tensho era (1573-1592), the Japanese started manufacturing their own copies of Portuguese playing cards, which were today known as Tensho Karuta.

During the Sakoku (1603-1868), The Japanese Shogunate severely limited trade between Japan and other countries, in order to eliminate any colonial and religious influence of primarily Spain and Portugal, after they have learned that the Philippines was colonized by Spain after its people were converted to Christianity. 

Moreover, Christianity was formally banned in Japan in 1612 and was subject to persecution. During this time, a Tensho Karuta deck hidden in a Buddhist altar would be a cause for people to accuse its owner of being Christian and have him executed. 

Because of this, card manufacturers tried to cover up or change the iconography of Tensho Karuta (due to their possible religious association) by heavily overprinted them with color or transformed them into abstract shapes or strokes.

Depending on the region of Japan it was made, the deck varied in design. These types of cards would be collectively known today as Mekurifuda, after a game it was played with.

# Deck Overview
Just like a Portuguese playing card deck, **there are 4 suits in a Mekurifuda deck** - clubs, swords, cups, and coins. **There are 12 ranks of cards: Dragon, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Maid, Horse, and King.** In some decks, a **joker card** is used, called **Onifuda** ('demon card') or Bakefuda ('monster card').

Some Mekurifuda patterns have gold and silver overprints to differentiate which card is which suit and to identify the point values of cards when playing Mekuri.

# Cards that Mimicked a Mekurifuda deck
## Shimafuda
Shimafuda (島札, lit. “Island Cards"), also known as Jifuda (字札, lit. “Character Cards”) or Ichi-Ni-San (一二三, lit. “One Two Three”, not to be confused with the game of the same name) is a type of Mekurifuda derivative that remained in Gushikawa, Uruma City, in the Okinawa prefecture of Japan. It is used to play [a game of the same name](/en/mekurifuda/games/shimafuda).

![shimafuda_cards.png](/suryongfiles/shimafuda_cards.png =500x)

The cards do not bear any Portuguese-derived designs; instead, numbers were represented by kanji on the upper half of each card, and points were represented by sticks or circles on the lower half of each card. 

However, the structure of the deck is consistent with mekurifuda decks, with the number 2 having three cards with points on them (*In a mekurifuda deck, the number 2 has three scoring cards: the 2 of Clubs, 2 of Swords, and 2 of Coin*s). 

Also, cards with **circles** on the lower half correspond to the **Swords** suit of mekurifuda decks, while cards **without markings** on the lower half correspond to the **Junks** of mekurifuda decks.

## Hanafuda
[Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) can be used to mimic a mekurifuda deck. Each flower represents a **month** of the year, which actually **corresponds to a number** in a mekurifuda deck.

The [standard month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) can be used in games where the type of cards rarely matter, such as Yomi-type, Kabu-type, and Kingo-type games. However, in games where the *exact* structure of a mekurifuda deck is required, the [**Nagoya** month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) is used, as described below.

|Mekurifuda</br>Number|Hanafuda</br>Month|Flower</br>Icon|Flower</br>Name|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**1 (Dragon)**|January|![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)|[Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine)|
|**2**|February|![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)|[Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow)|
|**3**|March|![Icon for month 3](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)|[Cherry Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom)|
|**4**|April|![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)|[Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria)|
|**5**|May|![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)|[Iris](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris)|
|**6**|June|![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)|[Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia)|
|**7**|July|![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)|[Bush Clover](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover)|
|**8**|August|![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)|[Susuki Grass](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass)|
|**9**|September|![Icon for month 9](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)|[Chrysanthemum](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum)|
|**10 (Maid**)|October|![Icon for month 10](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_10.png =20x)|[Maple](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple)|
|**11 (Horse)**|November|![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)|[Peony](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony)|
|**12 (King)**|December|![Icon for month 2](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x)|[Plum Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom)|

In the Nagoya month sequence, four of the months were shuffled about. The purpose seems to be so that the **Willow suit**, which has three scoring cards, takes the role of the **number 2** in a mekurifuda deck, which also has three scoring cards (*it is also worth mentioning that it is impossible to play certain mekuri games with a hanafuda deck if the standard month sequence is used, unless one junk of each month is marked to distinguish it from the other*), and that the **Phoenix card** takes the role of the **6 of Clubs** in a mekurifuda deck, which is usually overprinted with a gold 壽 (*kotobuki*, 'longevity').

The **highest scoring** card of each month (except for Willow; it's the Swallow card) correspond to the **Clubs** suit of mekurifuda.

The **ribbons**, as well as the Geese card and the yellow Paulownia chaff, correspond to the **Swords** suit of mekurifuda.

The **Rainman** corresponds to the **2 of Coins**.

**Other cards** correspond to the **Junks** of mekurifuda.
