**Mekurifuda** [めくり札], or Mekuri Karuta [めくりかるた], are a type of Japanese [karuta](/en/karuta) (playing cards) that were directly derived from [Tensho Karuta](/en/tensho) [天正かるた], which were faithful copies of Portuguese playing cards (Nanban Karuta [南蛮カルタ]).

There were many different Mekurifuda patterns depending on the region of Japan, but all of them consisted of 48 cards, and were structurally the same as a Portuguese playing card deck.

The name comes from the game [Mekuri](/en/mekurifuda/games/mekuri), a game which was thought of as a predecessor to [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), but has actually coexisted with the latter. However, these cards are not strictly used for Mekuri games only.

[**One-suited Mekurifuda decks**](/en/one-suited-mekurifuda-variants) were subsequently developed, which were designed for simpler betting games.

These card decks were subject to bans due to their association with gambling, which is also banned. Those caught in the act of gambling would be punished severely, or even put to death. Despite these harsh penalties, the use and gambling of karuta continued. 

There was a theory that gamblers turned to other kinds of cards such as [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) as a way to get around the bans. However, historical evidence suggests that games played using Hanafuda and games played using Mekurifuda coexisted, and there is also a theory that mekurifuda was used to play hanafuda games, not the other way around.

For a list of games played using these cards, see [Mekurifuda Games](/en/mekurifuda/games).

# History
The Portuguese first landed in Japan in 1543 on the island of Tanegashima, where they introduced matchlock firearms to Japan. Francis Xavier, a Jesuit missionary and representative of the King of Portugal, arrived in Japan in 1549 to propagate Christianity (Roman Catholicism) to the islands.

In 1571, Nagasaki was opened as a port for trade with other countries. It is believed that during this time, the Portuguese brought playing cards to Japan, which had only 48 cards and featured dragon designs on the aces. Nowadays, these Portuguese cards brought to Japan were classified as "*Nanban Karuta* [南蛮カルタ]", after the term used to refer to the foreign traders, *nanban* (南蛮, 'southern barbarians').

It was speculated that sometime during the Tensho era (1573-1592), the Japanese started manufacturing their own copies of Portuguese playing cards, which were then simply known as *karuta* (賀留多), after the Portuguese word for 'cards', *carta*. Nowadays, these domestic products are classified as Tensho Karuta, after the era in which they started to be made.

![tensho_karuta_deck_sample.png](/suryongfiles/tensho_karuta_deck_sample.png)

One of the places in Japan known to produce karuta around this time was Miike Village, Chikugo Province (present-day Omuta City, Fukuoka Prefecture). Japanese literature mentions karuta as a specialty of Miike Village as early as 1638.

In the following years, the Tensho Karuta industry would be affected by two factors:
- The cards were used as a tool for gambling, which is detrimental to public order and frowned upon by the ruling authorities.
- The cards featured foreign designs that could be mistaken for Christian iconography.

## Bans on Gambling with Karuta
The early punishments for gambling in Japan can be traced back to 1581, when a Japanese Christian (*kirishitan*), after failing to keep his pledge to stop gambling, was punished by rope bondage, and a fine of more than 80 Portuguese *cruzados* worth of rice. However, it is not known if karuta was involved.

In 1591, when Tokugawa Ieyasu and his clan transferred to the Kanto region, he immediately decreed that gambling is punishable by death. 

In **1597**, Chosokabe Motochika, the feudal lord of Tosa Province (present-day Kochi Prefecture), enacted the "**100 Articles of Chosokabe Motochika**" in Urado Castle, which issued a ban on gambling karuta games. This is by far **the earliest document in Japanese literature where the word "karuta" can be read**.

There were many other local bans on gambling with karuta during the following years within the period of Sakoku policy (1603-1868), but despite the bans, people played karuta undercover, and karuta became widespread in many provinces in Japan.

There were several documents that describe the punishment for evading the bans, as well as accounts of people caught and punished.

In 1683, in Edo, Kichizaemon and Kuzaemon were arrested for gambling with karuta, and were imprisoned for a year and a half, after which they were pardoned.

In 1702, in Edo, Shichirobei Akai Masayuki, a senior official of the front line, was appointed concurrently as a gambling inspector, and during his term, 3 people were executed and 18 were exiled for gambling. This punishment was criticized as being too harsh and severe, and he was eventually dismissed from his position as gambling inspector only 3 months after he was appointed.

In 1742, the 8th Shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, ordered the compilation of "*Kujikata Osadamegaki* (Book of Rules for Public Officials)" which describes the punishment for playing *yomikaruta* or betting games: 30 days of handcuffs for first offenders, and a fine of 3 kanmon (approx. 75,000 yen) for repeat offenders.

According to Jan Cock Blomhoff's description in a catalog of his collection of Japanese relics obtained in 1824, those who were caught gambling by the police were beaten with an iron rod 50 times for the first offense, or beaten with an iron rod 100 times and then imprisoned for the second offense, or executed for the third offense. 

## Bans on Producing and Selling Karuta
With the bans on gambling with karuta imposed, it can be assumed that the production and sale of karuta was also strictly controlled as well. There were many documents describing the prohibition of sale of Karuta.

In 1728 and 1731, there was a law in the Tottori Domain (now Tottori City, Tottori Prefecture) that prohibited the sale and purchase of karuta and dice.

In 1739, an notice was issued in Osaka, ordering all sellers of *kingo karuta* to stop their business, and those selling openly with a signboard should remove the signboard immediately.

In 1755, gambling karuta was also prohibited in the Kumamoto Domain (now Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture).

Because of such crackdowns, many karuta shops around Japan, mostly in Kyoto, were not allowed to sell karuta openly in their stores and disappeared. However, the industry continued undercover.

It is worthy of note that the prohibitions on karuta cover only those that were designed for playing gambling games. Because of this, Uta-garuta, such as [Hyakunin Isshu](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu), as well as other E-awase type karuta, were allowed to be sold openly.

## Soured Relations with Christianity in Japan
After Totoyomi Hideyoshi reunified Japan and became its ruler in 1586, he started to become suspicious of the growth of Christianity in Japan. By 1587, after his invasion of Kyushu, he was alarmed by reports of what the Jesuits were doing: they had claimed and garrisoned the city of Nagasaki, forcing commoners to convert to Christianity, taking and selling non-Christian Japanese from the port as slaves, and allowing the slaughter of horses and oxen for food, an offensive deed to Buddhism. 

Later that same year, Totoyomi Hideyoshi promulgated the Bateren Edict, aimed at expelling any Christian missionaries in Japan due to their clear violation of Buddhist law, prohibiting the slave trade, and promoting freedom and respect of all religions. While Hideyoshi was successful in taking back Nagasaki from the Jesuits, the edict was not strictly imposed, and missionaries still kept preaching openly around other parts of Japan. 

Then in 1596, The Spanish ship *San Felipe* was shipwrecked on the island of Shikoku, where the local feudal lord Chōsokabe Motochika seized the cargo of the ship and escalated the incident to Totoyomi Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi then learned from the pilot of the ship that it was Spain's plot to infiltrate countries with missionaries before an eventual military conquest. He also learned that the Philippines and several countries in the Americas were colonized by the Spanish after converting their inhabitants into Catholicism.

Hideyoshi was furious upon this revelation, and in 1597, Hideyoshi paraded and executed the 26 Martyrs of Japan by crucifixion, the first lethal execution of Christians in the country. The persecution of Christians continued until his death in 1598.

## Ban on Christianity and Beginning of *Sakoku* policy
When Tokugawa Ieyasu assumed power in 1600, he initially gave priority to trade with Portugal and Spain. Meanwhile, Dutch and English traders, in an attempt to take away control of trade from Portugal and Spain, advised Ieyasu that those countries indeed had territorial ambitions, using Christianity as their means to control the inhabitants, and that the Dutch and English would never conduct any missionary activities and would only focus on trade.

In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu issued an edict banning Christianity in Japan and ordering the destruction of Christian churches, claiming that Christians are bringing disorder to Japanese society. This was effective throughout the entire Edo period (1603-1868). All Japanese were required to register at a Buddhist temple, which became an annual requirement. Moreover, all European missionaries were expelled, and all Christian converts were executed, marking the end of open Christianity in Japan.

In addition, Tokugawa Ieyasu also imposed foreign trade policies (now known as *Sakoku* policy) which severely limited trade between Japan and other countries, effectively eliminating any colonial and religious influence of Spain and Portugal. During this time, the only westerners allowed to trade with Japan were the Dutch.

## Evolution of Tensho Karuta into Mekurifuda

Due to the ban on Christianity, local karuta manufacturers became wary of the designs on the cards, which featured foreign imagery that could be mistaken for Christian iconography, especially the suit of cups which looked like the Holy Grail. A person owning a Karuta deck could be accused of being Christian and executed. There was even a humorous account of this in a collection of Japanese stories in 1749, where Shigeemon of Hatchobori, Edo, discovered a piece of karuta in the Buddhist altar of his tenant Rokubei, and caused a big commotion by quickly assuming that Rokubei was a Christian. The story later goes on to describe how Shigeemon was punished for committing a crude offense because he did not know about karuta.

Considering this, it seemed that karuta manufacturers tried to cover up or change the iconography of Karuta. They replaced the courts with illustrations suitable for Japanese tastes, such as images of Samurai or Buddhist iconography. Eventually, manufacturers heavily overprinted them with color or transformed them into abstract shapes or strokes, likely as a way to reduce costs.

Also, the cards were made to be smaller than the Portuguese cards they were based on. It was initially thought to be an adaptation of a practice by the Portuguese traders to cut the edges of the cards and wrap them with backing paper once the edges started to wear out, but this is untrue. Nowadays, it is thought that the change in dimensions was likely to make the cards easier to be carried and held by Japanese hands.

The resulting Karuta decks slightly varied in design and structure depending on the region in Japan it was made, and the kind of game that was popular in those regions. These types of cards were given various names based on the games played with them, such as "Tensho Karuta", "Yomi Karuta", "Mekuri Karuta", "Kingo Karuta", "Kabu Karuta", etc., but because of the similarities in their structure and design, they are now all classified as Mekurifuda.

## The End of *Sakoku* policy and Birth of the Meiji era
After the Meiji restoration in 1868, initially the ban on playing and selling gambling karuta continued. However, in response to Britain's request for the elimination of non-tariff barriers in an attempt to overcome the slump in trade with Japan, the ban was eventually lifted in the following years.

This time, a different type of [western playing cards](/en/trump) featuring French suits were being brought to Japan. As early as 1879, rules for playing games with western playing cards were published, translated into Japanese.

In 1885, a company named Dandansha began importing and selling western playing cards, which were called "Trump". In 1886, Maeda Kihei established Kamigataya in Tokyo and started openly selling both western playing cards and Japanese karuta. He even promoted his shop through advertisements in newspapers. Following these events, all the existing karuta manufacturers that had been producing and selling karuta undercover started selling openly, one by one.

# Deck Overview
Just like a Portuguese playing card deck, **there are 4 suits in a Mekurifuda deck** - clubs, swords, cups, and coins. **There are 12 ranks of cards: Dragon, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Maid, Horse, and King.** In some decks, a **joker card** is used, called **Onifuda** ('demon card') or Bakefuda ('monster card').

![fukutoku_deck.png](/suryongfiles/fukutoku_deck.png =500x)

Some Mekurifuda patterns have gold and silver overprints to differentiate which card is which suit and to identify the point values of cards when playing Mekuri.

# Cards that Mimicked a Mekurifuda deck
## Shimafuda
Shimafuda (島札, lit. “Island Cards"), also known as Jifuda (字札, lit. “Character Cards”) or Ichi-Ni-San (一二三, lit. “One Two Three”, not to be confused with the game of the same name) is a type of Mekurifuda derivative that remained in Gushikawa, Uruma City, in the Okinawa prefecture of Japan. It is used to play [a game of the same name](/en/mekurifuda/games/shimafuda).

![shimafuda_cards.png](/suryongfiles/shimafuda_cards.png =500x)

The cards do not bear any Portuguese-derived designs; instead, numbers were represented by kanji on the upper half of each card, and points were represented by sticks or circles on the lower half of each card. 

However, the structure of the deck is consistent with mekurifuda decks, with the number 2 having three cards with points on them (*In a mekurifuda deck, the number 2 has three scoring cards: the 2 of Clubs, 2 of Swords, and 2 of Coin*s). 

Also, cards with **circles** on the lower half correspond to the **Swords** suit of mekurifuda decks, while cards **without markings** on the lower half correspond to the **Junks** of mekurifuda decks.

## Hanafuda
[Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) can be used to mimic a mekurifuda deck. Each flower represents a **month** of the year, which actually **corresponds to a number** in a mekurifuda deck.

The [standard month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) can be used in games where the type of cards rarely matter, such as Yomi-type, Kabu-type, and Kingo-type games. However, in games where the *exact* structure of a mekurifuda deck is required, the [**Nagoya** month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) is used, as described below.

|Mekurifuda</br>Number|Hanafuda</br>Month|Flower</br>Icon|Flower</br>Name|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**1 (Dragon)**|January|![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)|[Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine)|
|**2**|February|![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)|[Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow)|
|**3**|March|![Icon for month 3](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)|[Cherry Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom)|
|**4**|April|![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)|[Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria)|
|**5**|May|![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)|[Iris](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris)|
|**6**|June|![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)|[Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia)|
|**7**|July|![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)|[Bush Clover](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover)|
|**8**|August|![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)|[Susuki Grass](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass)|
|**9**|September|![Icon for month 9](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)|[Chrysanthemum](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum)|
|**10 (Maid**)|October|![Icon for month 10](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_10.png =20x)|[Maple](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple)|
|**11 (Horse)**|November|![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)|[Peony](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony)|
|**12 (King)**|December|![Icon for month 2](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x)|[Plum Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom)|

In the Nagoya month sequence, four of the months were shuffled about. The purpose seems to be so that the **Willow suit**, which has three scoring cards, takes the role of the **number 2** in a mekurifuda deck, which also has three scoring cards (*it is also worth mentioning that it is impossible to play certain mekuri games with a hanafuda deck if the standard month sequence is used, unless one junk of each month is marked to distinguish it from the other*), and that the **Phoenix card** takes the role of the **6 of Clubs** in a mekurifuda deck, which is usually overprinted with a gold 壽 (*kotobuki*, 'longevity').

The **highest scoring** card of each month (except for Willow; it's the Swallow card) correspond to the **Clubs** suit of mekurifuda.

The **ribbons**, as well as the Geese card and the yellow Paulownia chaff, correspond to the **Swords** suit of mekurifuda.

The **Rainman** corresponds to the **2 of Coins**.

**Other cards** correspond to the **Junks** of mekurifuda.
