Mekurifuda, or Mekuri Karuta, are a type of Japanese playing cards that were derived from Tensho Karuta, which were faithful copies of Portuguese playing cards (Nanban Karuta).

There were many Mekurifuda patterns, but all of them consisted of 48 cards, and were structurally the same as a Portuguese playing card deck.

They were created to get around the ban on cards bearing Portuguese playing card designs, by transforming the usual courts and dragons into abstract shapes or strokes.

The name comes from the game [Mekuri](/en/mekurifuda/games/mekuri), which was originally played using Tensho Karuta.

For a list of games played using these cards, see [Mekurifuda Games](/en/mekurifuda/games).
# Deck Overview
Just like a Portuguese playing card deck, **there are 4 suits in a Mekurifuda deck** - clubs, swords, cups, and coins. **There are 12 ranks of cards: Dragon, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Maid, Horse, and King.** 

Some Mekurifuda patterns have gold and silver overprints to differentiate which card is which suit and to identify the point values of cards when playing Mekuri.
