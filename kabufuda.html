<p>Kabufuda are the most common design of single-suited Japanese playing cards. This deck consists of 4 identical sets of cards valued from 1 to 10, with the exception of one Ace whose design differs from the others, and one “4” which features silver and/or gold overprinting. It ultimately derives from the suit of clubs used in Portuguese playing cards.</p>
