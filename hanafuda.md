*Hanafuda* 花札 [はなふだ], lit. “flower cards,” are Japanese playing cards used to play a variety of games, similarly to the standard Western playing card format. Unlike Western cards, however, the standard hanafuda deck consists of 12 suits of 4 cards each.

Each individual [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits), said to represent a month of the year, is themed around a particular plant, and has its own distribution of valuable cards. For instance, the [Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine) suit has one Bright card, one Poetry Ribbon, and two Chaff, whereas the [Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) suit has one Bright, one plain Ribbon, one Animal, and one Chaff. This asymmetrical suit structure is taken advantage of in many games, whose strategies revolve around capturing specific *yaku* [役 - やく] of cards within and across categories and suits.
