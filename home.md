Welcome!

This wiki has been created as a place to discuss various Japanese playing cards, including but not limited to Hanafuda and Karuta (Hyakunin-isshu and related) cards.

Some helpful pages to get started:
- [Hanafuda Suits](/en/hanafuda/suits)
- [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi)
- [Terms and Translations](/en/hanafuda/terms)

Most communication happens in the [Hanafuda Discord (#wikifuda)](https://discord.gg/kfqxFz).
