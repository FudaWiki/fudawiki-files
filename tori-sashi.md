There are 3 human roles: **Lord** [殿様, *tono-sama*], **Servant** [用人, *yōnin*], and **Bird Catcher** [鳥刺し, *tori-sashi*].

The other players play the role of different **birds**. Names of various birds are indicated on the remaining cards. 

> You can have as many different birds as you like, depending on the number of players. However, all players must know which birds are available in the game before playing.

Sometimes, **additional non-bird roles** are included to make the game more exciting.

# Methods of Playing
## Drinking/Punishment Game
Depending on the number of players, an equal number of cards should be prepared. 

Shuffle the cards well and deal to each player. Players may not show to the other players the cards they have.

Once all players received their roles, the game begins.

The **Lord** tells to the **Servant**, *"I'm going to play with the bird catcher today. Servant, call the bird catcher."*

The **Servant** tells to the **Bird Catcher**, *"Bird catcher, Your lord is calling you. Come."*

The **Bird Catcher** tells to the **Lord** and **Servant**, *"I am the bird catcher."*.

The **Lord** tells to the **Servant**, *"Servant, I want a [name of bird] caught today."*
The **Servant** then tells to the **Bird Catcher**, *"Bird catcher, please catch a [name of bird]."*

The **Bird Catcher** then **finds the person with the card containing the name of the bird** asked by the Lord.

- If the Bird Catcher chooses correctly, then the Lord will ask for another bird.

- If the Bird Catcher chooses **all birds correctly**, the **Bird Catcher wins** and the game ends.

- If the Bird Catcher chooses the **wrong bird**, then the **Bird Catcher loses and drinks/takes a punishment**. The game ends.

The game may be played as many times as desired.

## Playing for Chips

Depending on the number of players, an equal number of cards should be prepared. 

Before starting the game, give 24 chips to each player.

Shuffle the cards well and deal to each player. Players may not show to the other players the cards they have.

Once all players received their roles, the game begins.

The **Lord** tells to the **Servant**, *"I'm going to play with the bird catcher today. Servant, call the bird catcher."*

The **Servant** tells to the **Bird Catcher**, *"Bird catcher, Your lord is calling you. Come."*

The **Bird Catcher** tells to the **Lord** and **Servant**, *"I am the bird catcher."*.

The **Lord** tells to the **Servant**, *"Servant, I want a [name of bird] caught today."*
The **Servant** then tells to the **Bird Catcher**, *"Bird catcher, please catch a [name of bird]."*

The **Bird Catcher** then **finds the person with the card containing the name of the bird** asked by the Lord.

- If the Bird Catcher chooses correctly, then the game ends and the human role players win: the **player holding the correct bird pays 1 chip to the Lord, Servant, and the Bird Catcher**.
- If the Bird Catcher chooses the wrong bird, then the **Lord, Servant, and the Bird Catcher pays 1 chip to the player holding the wrong bird**. The game continues.



If the Bird Catcher chooses all birds correctly, the game ends and the Bird Catcher wins.

If the Bird Catcher chooses the wrong bird, then the Bird Catcher drinks/takes a punishment. The game then ends.

The game may be played as many times as desired.
