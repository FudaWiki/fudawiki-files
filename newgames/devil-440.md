The game can be played by 2 to 8 players, and is inspired by games like Last Card or UNO.

The game is similar to [Oni](/en/newgames/oni_greyson). 

# Goal
The goal of a player during a round is to discard all of their cards in hand before other players could do the same. During the game, a player tries to get as few points as possible to stay in the game.

Once a player reaches the target score, which is a certain amount of points (180 being the minimum), then the game ends, and the player with the least amount of points wins.

# Setup
First, players must agree to the amount of the target score.

Next, determine the first dealer. Each player draws a card from the face-down deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer.

## The Deal
The dealer shuffles the deck and deals **4 cards** to each player, **2 cards at a time**. Then, the dealer puts 1 card on the table face-up; this will become the **discard pile**. The rest of the deck is put face-down on the table as the **draw pile**.

# Gameplay
Turn moves in **clockwise** order, starting with the **player to the dealer's left**.

During each player's turn, they must **discard 1 card** from their hand, such that the *ones digit* of the sum of the discarded card and the card on top of the discard pile is **either 5 or 9**.

If a player is **unable to discard a card** from their hand, they must **draw 1 card from the draw pile**. If it can be discarded, then it **must be discarded**. If it cannot, then it **must be added to the player's hand**. In either case, the player's turn ends.

>If the draw pile is exhausted, then all but the top card in the discard pile are taken, shuffled, and placed on the table face-down as the new draw pile.

# End of Round and Scoring
The round ends once a player runs out of cards in hand, or plays a Special 1 or 4 card and decides to end the round prematurely; that player is declared the **winner** for that round and becomes the dealer for the next round.

At the end of each round, players count the points of the cards remaining in their hand, and the total is tabulated.

The game ends when a player's cumulative score reaches the agreed amount of points. **The player with the least amount of points wins the game**.

# Cards with Effects
- **Special 1** = if you discard it, you have the option to declare to end the round. If you choose to end, then points in all players' hands will be doubled, and then all points from the cards left in your hand will be added to your score. If you choose to continue, then the next player draws 1 and skips turn.
- **Special 4** = if you discard it, you have the option to declare to end the round. If you choose to end, then all points from the cards left in your hand will be doubled and then added to your score. If you choose to continue, then the next player draws 2 and skips turn.
- **10** = next player skips turn.

# Other Rules
- If the last card discarded by a player is a Special 4, then all opponents' points for that round are doubled.
- If the last card discarded by a player is a Special 1, then all opponents' points for that round are quadrupled.
- For every Special card in your hand, the points in your hand are doubled.

# Extended Deck Variant: 440
The game is the same as mentioned above except:
- Add 2 blank cards, 1 Onifuda, 5 Normal '1' cards, 1 Special '1' card, 2 Normal '4' cards, 1 Special '4' card, and 4 '10' cards to the deck. The deck will have 56 cards in it.
- Blank cards count as any number, and may follow or be followed by any card, except for Special cards. It is worth 20 points.
- Onifuda counts as any number, and may follow any card. The round ends immediately, and all players' points for that round are doubled.
- The minimum target score is 440 points.
