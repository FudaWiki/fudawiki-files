Kwa-Dō is a card game published by K.K. Corner and R. Whitbeck in 1959 for the American market, and was distributed by several different companies around the United States, including Renroc Inc. in Washington, and U.S. Games Systems, Inc. in Connecticut.

A set of Kwa-Dō includes cards of the same material and construction as western playing cards, but features a [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) design with illustrations drawn by Virginia Seeger, based on both Japanese hanafuda and Korean hwatu designs, as evident by the presence of both Japanese writings on the poetry ribbons and encircled "光" on all bright cards, which the game refers to as "*kwang*". Besides the cards themselves, it also includes a rulebook and a scoring pad, making the set resemble a contemporary Deluxe UNO set.

The rules of the game have been revised twice: in 1982 and 1985. It is not known when production of this game was discontinued, but judging from the fact that some sets using the 1985 rulebook have a barcode while others don't, it could be around late 1980's to early 1990's.

# Rules
The following rules are based on the rulesheet included in the 1985 version of Kwa-Dō.

The game is designed to be played by 2 to 6 players (team-playing is also allowed) , and is largely based on [Sakura](/en/hanafuda/games/sakura), with elements from other hanafuda games mixed in.

>The 1982 release mentions the maximum limit of players as "4 players", however, the 1985 release increases this limit to "6 players".
{.is-warning}

## Goal
The goal of a player/team is to **reach a total score of 200 points** before another player/team does the same.

## Setup
First, determine how many are to play and who will make up each team. 

For 2, 3, or 5 players, each participant plays on their own. 

A 4-player game may be either played individually, or in teams consisting of 2 players each. 

A 6-player game can likewise be played individually, in 3 teams of 2 players, or 2 teams of 3 players. 

>If playing in teams of 2, teammates should sit opposite one another; for teams of 3, players from each team should be seated alternately around the table.
{.is-info}

It is also a good idea to establish house rules and come to an agreement over [scoring](/#scoring) and whether to include the Yaku rules and Gaji rules in the game.

Next, determine who will be the first dealer. As per the rulebook, **any player may deal first**, but any method of determining the dealer may be used.

> There are no rules described in the rulebook regarding who will become the dealer on the next round. Traditionally, the player with most points becomes the dealer for the next round, but you may try other options, such as having the player to the dealer's left become the dealer of the next round regardless of scores. House rules prevail.
{.is-warning}

### The Deal
Once the cards have been shuffled and cut, the dealer passes out cards face down to each player and face up to the field according to the following chart.

|Number of Players||Cards to each Player|Cards to the Field|
|---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
|**2**|🧍🧍‍|8|8|
|**3**|🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️|7|6|
|**4**|🧍‍🧍‍🧍‍🧍‍|5|8|
|**5**|🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️|4|8|
|**6**|🧍‍🧍‍🧍‍🧍‍🧍‍<br>🧍‍|3|12|

Any remaining cards form the draw pile for the round and are to be placed in a single face down stack beside the field cards.

>It is not stated in the rulebook what to do when four cards of the same suit have been dealt to the table. Usually it is considered a misdeal, although there are also other ways of dealing with this situation. House rules prevail.
{.is-warning}

## Gameplay
The player to the **left of the dealer** takes the first turn, followed by each player around the table in **clockwise order**.

When playing with teams, each team shares a common score pile. 

### Turns
> The core gameplay is the same as in [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), albeit not fully explained in the rulebook.
{.is-warning}

On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the field.

* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the field**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the field**, then the player may choose which one they capture.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the field**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the field are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the field, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player *must* capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type to make detecting yaku easier.<br><br>However, since Chaff are worth 0 points and play no role in any yaku, it is practical to **discard all Chaff cards** to a common junk pile. 
{.is-warning}



## End of Round
The round ends once **all players run out of cards**. Afterward, the round is scored.


## Scoring
The rulebook provides two methods of dealing with scoring in the game. Players must agree first which method to be used before playing the game.

### Method A: Floor Method
Each player/team counts the total value of their captured cards.

Then, the **"floor"** (par score) is subtracted to each player's/team's captured card score to obtain the **net scores**.

`Net Score = Total of captured card points - Floor value`

The floor is obtained by dividing 240 points, which is the total card points in the deck, by the number of players/teams participating in the game.

`Floor Value = 240 points / Number of players`

|Number of Players/Teams|Floor Value|
|:---:|---:|
|**2**|120 points|
|**3**|80 points|
|**4**|60 points|
|**5**|48 points|
|**6**|40 points|

A player/team with a **positive** net score **adds** that score to their total score in the game. 

`Player's/Team's Total Score = Sum of the net scores obtained in every round`

> **Negative** net scores are treated as **0 points**.
{.is-warning}

### Method B: Easy Method
Each player/team counts the total value of their captured cards.

Then each player/team adds that score to their total score in the game. 

`Player's/Team's Total Score = Sum of captured card scores obtained in every round`


## End of Game
Regardless of which method of scoring is used, the goal remains the same: to obtain a total score of **200 points**. 

As soon as a player/team reaches that goal, the game ends, and that player/team is declared the **winner** of the game.

If the goal is not reached, play continues for another round.

## Card Values
Card values are standard except that **Chaff are worth 0 points**.

|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Brights ("Kwang")|20|5|
|Animals|10|9|
|Ribbons|5|10|
|Chaff|0|24|

The total card points in the deck is 240 points.

> The rulebook suggests that a player must declare "Kwa-Dō!" everytime they capture a Bright card, just for fun.
{.is-info}

## Yaku (Optional Rule)
> Decide first which of these Yaku are to be used before playing the game.
{.is-warning}

### Months Yaku
Worth **30 points** each.

### Five Brights
Worth **100 points**.
[![Pine With Crane](/sheldonchen-cards/10.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun)[![Cherry Blossom with Curtain](/sheldonchen-cards/30.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain)[![Susuki Grass with Moon](/sheldonchen-cards/80.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon)[![Willow with Rain Man](/sheldonchen-cards/110.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man)[![Paulownia with Phoenix](/sheldonchen-cards/120.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)

### "Dragon" Bonus
The Phoenix card (Bright of Paulownia ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)), which is erroneously refered to as a "Dragon" in the rulebook, is worth **25 bonus points** in addition to its card value of 20 points.
[![Paulownia with Phoenix](/sheldonchen-cards/120.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)

### Sakura Yaku
The 8 Yaku from the game Sakura were also borrowed for this game. The 1985 rulebook refers to them as "Yakus", and curiously, they are the only group of yaku in the game to be refered to as "yaku", while other yaku are only refered to as "bonus awards".

Each Sakura Yaku is worth **30 points**.

>The 1985 rulebook states that you must first declare to be "building a yaku", before placing any one of the three cards of a yaku into the field, and then you must try to capture all remaining cards of the yaku within that round to avail its points.

>The 1982 rulebook only counts **Set #8 (Red poetry ribbons)** as a "bonus award", and didn't include the rest of the Sakura yaku, nor did it include the "declaring the yaku" rule.
{.is-warning}

## Gaji (Optional Rule)

The [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) card is known as Gaji in this game, and acts as a wild card. 

[![Willow with Lightning](/sheldonchen-cards/113.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning)

When played from the hand, it may pair with and thus capture any card on the field. However, if the Gaji is already on the field, it can only be captured by another [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) card.

Once captured, keep the Gaji with the card it was paired with. At the end of the round, if any other cards of the paired card's suit are present on the field, they are automatically captured by the player who used the Gaji.
