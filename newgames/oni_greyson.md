The game can be played by 2 to 8 players, and is inspired by games like Last Card or UNO.

# Goal
The goal of a player during a round is to discard all of their cards in hand before other players could do the same.

Once a player accumulates a certain amount of points- either 270 points or 570 points-, then the game ends with that player becoming the winner.

# Setup
First, players must agree to the amount of the goal score, either 270 points or 570 points.

Next, determine the first dealer. Each player draws a card from the face-down deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer.

## The Deal
The dealer shuffles the deck and deals **4 cards** to each player, **2 cards at a time**. Then, the dealer puts 1 card on the table face-up; this will become the **discard pile**. The rest of the deck is put face-down on the table as the **draw pile**.

# Gameplay
Turn moves in **clockwise** order, starting with the **player to the dealer's left**.

During each player's turn, they must **discard 1 card** from their hand that is of the **same month** (flower) or **same type** (bright, animal, ribbon, chaff) **as the card on top of the discard pile**. Then their turn ends.

If a player is **unable to discard a card** from their hand, they must **draw 1 card from the draw pile**. If it has the **same month or type** as the card on top of the discard pile, then it **must be discarded**. If it **doesn't**, then it **must be added to the player's hand**. In either case, the player's turn ends.

>If the draw pile is exhausted, then all but the top card in the discard pile are taken, shuffled, and placed on the table face-down as the new draw pile.

## Special Cards
- **poetry ribbons** = next player draws 2 and skips turn
- **blue ribbons** = next player draws 1 and skips turn
- **yellow paulownia** = next player draws 5 without skipping their turn
- **bridge** = you get another turn, however, you must discard a card on top of the bridge card. if you can't, you must draw cards until you are able to do so. you cannot end the round using the bridge card (if you discard the bridge and it's the last card in your hand, then you must draw card(s) until you can discard a card on top of the bridge).
- **any willow card** = next player skips turn
- **sake cup** = counts as both animal and junk, and may be discarded onto either an animal or junk card, or may be followed by another card that is either an animal or junk.
- **lightning** = if you discard it, you have the option to declare to end the round. If you do, all points from the cards left in your hand will be deducted from your positive score. you cannot discard this card during your first turn.

# End of Round
The round ends once a player runs out of cards in hand; that player is declared the **winner** for that round and becomes the dealer for the next round.

# Scoring
Each of the other players count the card points in their hand.

The winner gets **positive points** equal to the **sum of the card points of all the other players' hands.**

The losers get **negative points** equal to the **card points in their own hand**.

> Optional: You may also play such that the losers get 0 points. Players must agree to this rule first before playing.

## Card Points
Card Points are **standard**, with some exceptions.

|Card Type|Value|
|:---:|:---:|
|Brights|20|
|Animals|10|
|Ribbons|5|
|Chaff|1|

### Exceptions
- the **yellow paulownia** alone is worth 10 points, but if the hand contains other cards, then it is worth 1 point only.
- the **rainman** alone is worth 20 points, but if the hand contains other cards, then the rainman is worth 5 points only.
- the **lightning** alone is worth 1 point, but if the hand contains other cards, then the lightning is worth no points, and all other cards' values are doubled.

### Bonuses
- if a player ends the round by discarding a rainman, then each loser must pay an additional 5 points to the winner.
- if a player ends the round by discarding a lightning, then all card points in each player's hand are doubled (after applying other bonuses, if any)
- if the dealer ends the round, then all card points in each player's hand are doubled (after applying other bonuses, if any)

## Tabulating the Scores
The scores for each month are tabulated, and the total scores of each player are checked if any has reached the goal score.

Once the goal score is reached by a player, the game ends, and that player becomes the winner of the game.
