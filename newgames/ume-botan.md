**Ume Botan**, or **Ume Botan Rule** is a hanafuda game created by Ume Botan [梅牡丹, *lit. 'plum peony'*], also known as Ume Chan or Ume Channel. He is a Japanese blogger from Kansai Region, and has a wife who is from Tokyo.

After learning that the rules of the game he played using hanafuda is different from those his wife played, he did some research and found out how many different local rules hanafuda has. So, by combining various local rules played in different places in Japan, he and his wife created this game.

The game can either be played by 3 or 4 players at the same time.

# Setup
Game setup involves deciding the seating position, shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. 

**A full game consists of 12 rounds**; Whether a game should last for more or less rounds is up to the player (as long as the number of rounds is even). Any other house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

## Deciding the Seating Position
Shuffle the deck and have all players draw one card each. 

The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes **"Player 1"** (also known as the "oya" [親 - おや, *lit. "parent"*]), followed by **"Player 2"**, and so on.

The **last player** in line becomes the dealer. 

>If two or more players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card is treated as having the earlier suit. If even the card points are tied, then the players must draw again.
{.is-info}

After the sequence has been decided, all players must sit in line counter-clockwise around the table. This means that Player 1 sits first, Player 2 sits to the right of Player 1, etc.

## Distributing the Initial Cards
The **last player** in line shuffles the deck, asks Player 1 to cut the cards, and then distributes the cards.

If there are 3 players: **7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards face-up to the table.**

If there are 4 players: **5 cards are dealt to each player, and 8 cards face-up to the table.**

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

>If **4 cards of the same suit are dealt to the field** at the beginning of a round, generally a **misdeal** is declared and the same dealer shuffles and distributes cards once more. 
{.is-info}

>If the **![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning Card** is dealt to the field, then Player 1 *must* capture it with the card on top of the draw pile during their first turn, regardless of the suit of the drawn card.<br><br>In the author's rules, this is done by immediately taking the top card from the draw pile and placing it on top of the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning face-down *before* Player 1 starts their turn. During Player 1's first turn, instead of playing a card from the draw pile, they take the Lightning card and the face-down card.
{.is-info}

## Field Multiplier
Next, the round number is checked, as well as the presence of ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine cards on the field, to determine if there is a *field multiplier*. 

Field Multipliers are **mutually exclusive**; If at least one field multiplier is present during a round, then point exchanges (after all calculations are done) will be **doubled** for that round only.


|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|Normal Field|A *normal field* [平場 - ひらば, *hiraba*] occurs if there are no field multipliers. Point exchanges are unaffected.|
|**Pine Field**|A *pine field* [松場 - まつば, *matsuba*] occurs if one or more ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine cards are present on the field. Point exchanges will be **doubled** for this round.|
|**Midterm Field**|A *midterm field* [半期場 - はんきば, *hankiba*] occurs during Round 6 (or the last round of the first half of the game). All point exchanges will be **doubled** for this round, even if ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine cards are present on the field.
|**Final Field**|A *final field* [締め場 - しめば, *shimeba*] occurs during Round 12 (or the final round). All point exchanges will be **doubled** for this round, even if ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine cards are present on the field.

# Gameplay
In each round, **Player 1** is the first to play, and turn to play passes counter-clockwise around the table. The core gameplay and turn structure is utterly typical of hanafuda fishing games such as [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase).

## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.

* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player may choose which one they capture.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player *must* capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (Brights, Animals, Ribbons, and Chaff) to make detecting yaku easier.
{.is-warning}

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion.

After both cards have been played- one from the player's hand, and one from the draw pile- the turn ends, and the next player takes their turn.

## Wild Card
The ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card serves as a wild card, and can be used to capture any other individual card except another [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow).

If it is on the field, **it must be captured by Player 1 using the card drawn from the deck during their first turn, regardless of its suit**.

> This is different from the game [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi), where the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card on the field is captured by the first non-willow card drawn from the draw pile.
{.is-info}

If it is dealt on a player's hand, that player **may use it to capture a non-Willow card** during any of their turns.

If it is drawn from the deck, **it must capture a non-Willow card on the field.**. If there are no non-Willow cards on the field, then it is **taken alone** into the scoring area.

> Again, this is different from the game Mushi, where if there are no non-Willow cards on the field, then it is discarded onto the field, to be captured later.
{.is-info}

## End of Round
The current round ends when all players have run out of card in their hands. This will also coincide with the draw pile being emptied.

Due to the usage of a wild card, most rounds will end with two unpaired cards - one ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow, and one that matches the suit of whatever card was captured by the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning. In this case, **the player who used the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card takes both cards into their scoring area.**

> Again,this is different from Mushi, where the last ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow will be added to the scoring area of the player who captured the other two non-wild ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willows, and the remaining card is added to the scoring area of the player who used the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning to capture its mate.
{.is-info}

> Due to the '![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning on the field' rule, it is possible that the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card gets captured by a ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow card. In this case, there will be no cards left on the field at the end of the round.
{.is-warning}

> It is also possible that either 1 or 4 cards will be left on the field at the end of the game instead of 2. In this case, it is presumed that **the player who used the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card takes all leftover cards into their scoring area.**
{.is-warning}

## Scoring
The game uses a zero-sum scoring system common to many other such hanafuda games. 

First, each player adds up the total points of all their captured cards. The values of the cards are completely standard, as follows:

|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Brights|20|5|
|Animals|10|9|
|Ribbons|5|10|
|Chaff|1|24|

The total point value of the entire deck is 264.

- With **three players**, each player could conceivably earn exactly 88 points (one third of 264), the actual score each player earns is their total number of card points, minus the ***par value* of 88**.

- With **four players**, each one could potentially earn exactly 66 points. So again, the actual points earned is the total of the player's card points, minus the ***par value* of 66**.

Then, yaku are handled. Each player adds up the total value of their captured yaku, and they recieve this value from each of the other players. For example, in a 3-player game, if player A has 40 points' worth of yaku, then they score 80 points in total- 40 from player B, and 40 from player C- while players B and C will each *lose* 40 points.

In short, the total amount of points gained or lost by each player at the end of the round will be given by the following:

`Player's Score = (Player's Total Card Points - Par Value) + (Total Value of Player's Yaku x (Number of Players - 1)) - Total Value of All Opponents' Yaku`,

where the *par value* is equal to 264 divided by the number of players - 66 for four players, 88 for three.

>If field multiplier(s) are present, then this calculation will be **doubled**.
{.is-info}

The player with the **highest score** at the end of the round becomes **Player 1** for the next round. In the event of a tie, the player who was *earliest* in the turn order becomes Player 1.

On the other hand, the player with the **lowest score** at the end of the round becomes the **last player** as well as the **dealer** for the next round, and must sit on the left side of whomever becomes Player 1.

## End of Game
After the desired number of rounds have been played, the player with the highest total score at the end of all the rounds is the winner of the game.

# Yaku
Points from multiple yaku stack, with the following exception:
- All Yaku with *Brights* in their name are mutually exclusive.

In these cases, the player claims the most valuable of the mutually exclusive yaku.
