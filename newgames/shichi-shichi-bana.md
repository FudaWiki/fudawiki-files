**Shichi-shichi-bana** [七七花, lit. '77 flowers'], is thought to be an adaptation of the game [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) or [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), using an expanded **14-month hanafuda deck**, produced by Tezuka Karuta Kobo and manufactured by Matsui Tengudo. It is intended to be played by **4 active players** at the same time.

The game is named after the par score of 77 points.

The rulesheet supplied with the 14-month deck does not give a detailed explanation of the game; rather, it only explains the functions of the 8 additional cards, the par score, the number of cards per deal, the Teyaku and the Dekiyaku. All yaku do not have scores, and it is up to the player to assign scores for them.

> **NOTE: You need a 14-month hanafuda deck to play this game.**

# The Par Score
The additional 8 cards are worth 44 points in total. Since the standard deck has a total of 264 points, the total points of the 14-month deck is 308 points.

Dividing this total points between four players will give the par score of **77 points**.

# The Deal
Deal 6 cards to each player's hand, and 8 cards face-up on the field, and the rest of the deck is put face-down on the table as the draw pile.

# Yaku
> **NOTE: Points are not specified with the leaflet of the game; players are expected to assign their own points for these Yaku.**
