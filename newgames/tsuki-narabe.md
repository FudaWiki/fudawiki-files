Tsuki Narabe [月ならべ, 'month line-up'] is a simple draw-and-discard Hanafuda game for 3-4 players, designed to make players more familiar with the hanafuda month sequence.

# The Game
All 48 cards of hanafuda are used.

**The goal is for a player to have 5 cards in hand whose month numbers are in sequential order.**

> The month sequence loops: A december card may be followed by a January card. (Example: November, December, January, February, March)
{.is-info}

Decide first who will be the dealer using any method you prefer.

Dealer shuffles and deals 4 cards to each player. The rest of the deck is placed face-down on the table as the draw pile.

Starting with the dealer counter-clockwise, each player draws a card from the draw pile and adds it to their hand. Then the player discards a card from their hand which they do not need. Turn passes to the next player.

Once a player has 4 cards in month sequence (example: May, June, July, August), then the player continues their turns as normal until they could draw a card that completes the month sequence (regarding the previous example, this would either be an April or a September card). When they do, they reveal their hand to other players and declare victory.
