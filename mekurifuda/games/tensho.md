**Tensho** was a mekurifuda game for two players, likely originating in the Nagoya region of Japan. 

This game was originally played using a [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda) deck called Ise. It can also be played using Hanafuda; click [here](/en/hanafuda/games/tensho) to see the rules using Hanafuda.

# Setup
First, **prepare the Ise deck by removing the 6 of swords, 6 of cups, 6 of coins, and the extra "bakefuda" (ghost card)**, leaving a **45-card** deck. Choose the initial dealer in whatever manner preferred. **In subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round becomes the new dealer.** Player should also agree on the duration of the game - some common options are 3, 6, or 12 rounds.
## Yaku Selection
One unique characteristic of Tensho is that it has **two sets of yaku**, **only one of which is chosen** for use each round. This decision should be made **prior to the deal,** before either player has any information. If the players **cannot agree** on a set to use, the choice defaults to the **dealer's preference.**
## Distributing the Cards
![tensho_distribution.gif](/hanafuda/tensho_distribution.gif =400x)

The dealer shuffles the deck. There is a specific method of dealing the cards associated with this game:
1. Place **3 cards** face down next to each other **on the field**.
2. Deal **4 stacks of 3 cards each,** face down in the four corners around the field.
3. Place **another 3 cards face down on the field** in a row below the first 3.
4. Add **another 3 cards to each of the existing stacks** in the corners of the field.
5. Put **3 final cards face down onto the field** in a third row, for **a total of 9 cards** face down on the field in a 3 by 3 grid.
6. Finally, add **3 more cards each to 2 of the stacks** in the corners of the field.
7. The remaining **6 cards are set aside as "dead cards"** this round and will not be used to play Tensho, but may be used to play [Tokotoko](/en/hanafuda/games/tokotoko).
8. **The dealer chooses one of the stacks of 6 cards to become his hand;** the other becomes the opponent's hand.
9. **The 2 stacks of 9 cards are combined** to become the **draw pile** for the round.
10. Play [Shoniban](/en/hanafuda/games/shoniban) if desired, and **reveal the 9 cards on the field.**

If this is too convoluted, the important thing is to ensure that **each player has a 6-card hand,** and that there are **9 cards face up on the field**, **6 "dead cards"** set aside, and an **18-card draw pile.**

# Gameplay
Gameplay proceeds in much the same manner as other fishing games, with the **dealer playing first**. However, **if there are 3 cards of the same number on the field at the beginning of the game, the dealer may capture two of those cards, and will instead play second.**

On your turn, add one card from your hand to the field, followed by the top card of the draw pile, matching each of them by **number** with a card on the field if possible. If a pair is made, capture those cards and add them to your scoring area.

Note that since the **6 of clubs** is the only card in the deck that has the number 6, the player who plays or draws this card simply places it directly in their own scoring area without first sending it to the field. **If the 6 of clubs is dealt to the field at the beginning of the game, neither player can capture it.**

Play continues back and forth with each player repeating the above steps in turn, until either one player has collected an **instant-win yaku**, or both players have **run out of cards**.

## End of Round
**The round ends as soon as a player has captured one of the "Instant Win" yaku.** Otherwise, players continue taking turns until they have both exhausted their hands, at which point they add up the points for all yaku they have collected. **The player who has earned the most points from yaku is declared the winner of the round.**
### Breaking Ties
If, however, neither player has completed any yaku, or otherwise their **yaku scores are the same**, then **the player who has captured the most Chaff cards wins**.

If players are tied with regards to both yaku **and** number of Chaff captured, each player totals the sum of points for their respective captured cards, according to the **Card Values** chart below. 
# Yaku

## Both Sets
The first 12 yaku in Tensho are common to both sets of yaku, and thus are always valid. There are two other yaku (Front Elder and Back Elder) that technically fall into this category, but they are listed separately since they change values depending on which yaku set is selected.
