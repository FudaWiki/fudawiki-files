**Dontsuku** (どんつく) is a [Kingo](/en/hanafuda/games/kingo) variant for 2 to 8 players. It was attested to be played in the Kamikita district, in the Aomori prefecture in Japan.

It is traditionally played using a [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda) deck called Kurofuda.

The game is notable among Kingo-type games for adding a variation in gameplay, where players may choose to request for cards face-down instead of being visible to the player, which gives them privilege over those who requested cards face-up.

# The Cards
**48** cards of a Kurofuda deck is used. Remove the extra Onifuda card from the deck.

## Card Points
All cards from 1 to 9 are worth **face value**, while all court cards (Maid, Horse, King) are worth **10 points**.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, oya], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

A decision must be made as to how long the game will last - 12 rounds is traditional, though other common options are 6 rounds, 3 rounds, or until all but one player runs out of stones.

Also, a decision must also be made as to how much points a **share** costs per round. It may be fixed throughout the game, or changed every time a round starts (the decision of which may be done either before or after dealing the cards, usually by the dealer).

## Choosing the Dealer
Shuffle the deck and have all players draw one card each. The player who drew a card with the **lowest number** becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.

## Dealing the Initial Cards
The dealer shuffles the cards and deals one card to each player's hand, starting from the player to the dealer's right up to the dealer himself/herself. The rest of the cards are put face-down on the table as the draw pile.

Once the initial cards are dealt, each player looks at the card dealt to them, and the round begins.

# Gameplay
Each round, the player to the dealer's right is the first to play, and the dealer is last to play. Turn to play goes counter-clockwise.

During a player's turn, they may request one of the following to the dealer:
- **"Motto"** - ask the dealer for 1 more card into the player's hand. The player may keep asking for more cards until their hand value total **becomes close to 15**, then they **pass the turn** to the next player.
- **"Tsukkome"** - ask the dealer for a specified number of cards, which will be **given to the player face-down**, then **pass the turn** to the next player. The player may not peek at them until it's their turn to showdown. There will be a privilege later.

# Nai (Bust hand)
If the player's hand value **reaches 16 or higher**, the player must declare **"Nai"**. 

The player automatically **loses the round** and has to **discard their hand** **face-down** and **pass the turn** to the next player immediately.

# End of Round
The round ends when a player declares Agari, or when all players have passed their turn.

## Agari (Stop the round)
If a player's hand value **reaches 15 points** or **forms a Teyaku**, the player must declare **"Agari"**. 

The round ends immediately, and that player **becomes the winner**.

> In any case, the winner **receives 1 share** from each of the other players, and if the winner has availed a **Bonus**, then the payment is **doubled**. The winner also **becomes the dealer for the next round**.
{.is-info}

If all players pass their turn without declaring "Agari", then it's time for the Tsukkome Showdown.

## Tsukkome Showdown
Players with "Tsukkome" take all their face-down cards into their hand and then reveal their hands.

If a player's hand value **reaches 15 points** or **forms a Teyaku**, they **become the winner**.

> If there are multiple winners, then the dealer or the player nearest to the dealer's right wins.
{.is-info}

## 14 Showdown
If nobody has a 15-point hand or a Teyaku, then the **player ("tsukkome" or not) who has a 14-point hand wins**.

## Tsukkome 13 Showdown
If nobody has a 14-point hand, then **the player who has "tsukkome" and has a 13-point hand wins.**

**If nobody still wins at this point, the round is forfeited and the cards are redealt.**

> For this reason, a person who didn't declare "tsukkome" must keep asking for cards until their hand reaches **at least 14 points**, since any points below that is considered a losing hand.
{.is-warning}

# Bonus
The payment will be doubled if:
-  A player forms a yaku that gives a bonus.
- A player’s hand is 15 points and forms a yaku.
- A player has “tsukkome” and either has a 15-pt. hand or a yaku.
