**Hiyoko** (ひよこ, 'chick') was a Mekurifuda sequence game for 2 players. It is also known as **Shosho** (しょっしょ).

This game was originally played using a [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda) deck called Ise. It can also be played using Hanafuda; click [here](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko) to see the rules using Hanafuda.

# Setup
The game uses **45 cards** from an **Ise** deck. Remove the **6 of swords, 6 of cups, 6 of coins**, and the extra **bakefuda (ghost card)** from the deck before playing.

Players determine first who is the dealer. The dealer then shuffles the cards and deals **6** cards to each player, and **1** card on the table face up (this becomes the **discard pile**). The remaining cards are put on the table face down as the **draw pile**.

# Gameplay
Dealer plays first.

During a player's turn, he/she looks at the topmost card in the discard pile, and then **discards from his/her hand a card of the next number**.

*Example: There is a 7 card on the discard pile.
Player must discard an 8 card.*

>If the card on the discard pile is a 12 (king) card, you must discard a 1 (dragon) card.
{.is-info}

After the player has discarded, he/she may also discard another card of the next month from the previously discarded card, and **keep discarding until he/she doesn't have a card in the month sequence**.

*Example: There is a 6 card on the discard pile.
Player has a 7 card and 8 card in his/her hand.
Player **discards the 7 card, then the 8 card.***

If the **dealer doesn't have a card of the next number** in his/her hand **during his/her first turn**, he/she **passes** his/her turn to the other player. If the other player also doesn't have a card of the next number in his/her hand and passes his/her turn back to the dealer, the **dealer draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

If the **dealer discards a card(s), then passes the turn** to the other player, and the other player **doesn't have a card of the next number** in his/her hand and **passes** the turn back to the dealer, the **dealer draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

If the **other player discards a card(s), then passes the turn** to the dealer, and the dealer **doesn't have a card of the next number** in his/her hand and **passes** the turn back to the other player, the **other player draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

In all cases, the player who drew a card and put it on the discard pile must discard a card of the next number from the new top card of the discard pile afterward. 

>NOTE: Some situations were left unexplained. *(What happens when the player who drew a card doesn't have a card of the next number?)*
{.is-warning}

> If the draw pile runs out of cards, form a new deck by taking all cards from the discard pile except for the top card. Shuffle the deck and put it back on the table face down.
{.is-info}

# One-Two Combo
If the card on the discard pile is a 1 (dragon) card, and you have both a 1 (dragon) card and a 2 card in your hand, instead of just discarding the 2 card, **you can discard the 1 (dragon) card first before discarding the 2 card**.

# Ghost Cards
In Hiyoko, there are **10 Ghost Cards** (化札 [ばけふだ, *bake-fuda*]). These are considered special cards in the game.

The first five cards in the list can be **counted as a Ghost Card either in the hand or on the discard pile**. They can be discarded if the top card on the discard pile is a number before any of the numbers assigned to the Ghost Card. Also, if they are on the discard pile, They can be followed with a card of the next number from any of the numbers assigned to the Ghost Card.

|Ghost Card|Description|
|:---:|:---:|
|1 (dragon) of clubs|Counts as 1 to 10.|
|1 (dragon) of swords|Counts as 1 to 10.|
|2 of clubs|Counts as 2 to 11.|
|2 of swords|Counts as 2 to 11.|
|3 of swords|Counts as all numbers.|

The next five cards in the list can **only be counted as a Ghost card when drawn from the draw pile**. If it's in your hand or if it's discarded from a player's hand, only the actual number of the card is counted.

|Ghost Card|Description|
|:---:|:---:|
|6 of clubs|Counts as 1 only.|
|12 (king) of swords|Counts as 1 only.|
|12 (king) of either cups or coins|Counts as 1 only.|
|12 (king) of clubs|Counts as all numbers.|

# Winning the Round
During each round, the goal is to **get rid of all the cards in your hand before the other player does**. If you do, you earn **1 point**, and become the dealer for the next round.

# End of the Game
**First player to earn 3 points wins the game**.

# Isuri (Hiyoko variant)
Isuri [いすり] is a [Hiyoko](/en/mekurifuda/games/hiyoko) variant for 2 players. Like Hiyoko, it was originally played using a mekurifuda deck called Ise.

The rules are identical to Hiyoko, with some exceptions:
- **46 cards** from an Ise deck is used. Remove only the 6 of cups and 6 of coins, and the extra "bakefuda" card. **The 6 of swords is treated as the same as the 6 of clubs.**
- The scoring system in Hiyoko, which is based on players discarding all of their cards, is replaced with a dynamic scoring system: **A player gets paid immediately for each card they discard.** *(See **Card Values**)*
- If you **pass** the turn, you must place **1 point** on the table as a *Passing Penalty*. The player who gets rid of all the cards in their hand takes all points from the Passing Penalty.
- **You may discard 3 to 6 cards of the same month at once!** You get paid for each of the cards discarded this way.
- If you manage to **discard all 6 cards in your hand in one turn** [総出し - そうだし, *sou-dashi*], you get **10 bonus points**.

## Card Points
1 (Dragon) = 10 pts.
Other numbers = same points as the number
