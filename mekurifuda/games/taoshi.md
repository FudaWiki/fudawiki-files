UNDER CONSTRUCTION

**Taoshi** - 倒し [タオシ, lit. "knocking down"] is a [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda) [game](/en/mekurifuda/games) for 3 players.

It has three major distinguishing features: an unusual distribution of card values, with Sword cards being the least valuable instead of Cups and Coins; a sizeable list of teyaku which have similarities to those in [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi); and the relative paucity of dekiyaku: only one that is capturable by any player, and another that can only be captured by the player to the left of the dealer.

# Equipment
48 cards of either an Akahachi or Ise deck may be used. Remove the extra "onifuda/bakefuda" from the deck.

# Setup
## Choosing the Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the initial dealer. A mekurifuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the highest number becomes the dealer. If there is a tie, then the players re-draw.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Dealing the Cards
The player to the left of the dealer [尾季 - びき, *biki*] shuffles the deck, and the player to the right of the dealer [胴二 - どうに, *douni*] cuts. Then, starting with the player to their right and moving anti-clockwise (↺), the dealer deals 4 cards to each player in turn, followed by 3 card face-up to the table. They then give a further 3 cards to each player, and an additional 3 cards face-up to the table.

**In total, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards to the table face-up to form the field.**

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field to form the draw pile.

* If 4 cards of the same number are dealt to the table, then a misdeal is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

# Teyaku
The **Teyaku** - 手役 [てやく] in this game are similar to those used in Hachi-Hachi.

Teyaku are mutually exclusive; players may only avail their highest scoring Teyaku.

|Points|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|10|**Triplet/Three of a Kind**<br/>三本 [さんぼん, *sanbon*]|Any three cards of the same month.|
|20|**Three Pairs**<br/>喰付 [くっつき, *kuttsuki*] (lit. *sticky?*)|Three pairs of cards of different months.|
|30|**Four-Three**<br/>四三 [しそう, *shisou*]|Four cards of one suit and a triplet of another.|
|10|**Three Ribbons**<br>短三枚 [なさけ, *nasake*]|Any 3 Ribbons and/or [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards. Note that only the second player, i.e. the one to the right of the dealer, may claim this particular Lucky Hand!|

# Gameplay
In each round, the dealer is the first to play, and turn to play passes anti-clockwise (↺) around the table. The core gameplay and turn structure of Hachi-Hachi is typical of games in the *Hana-Awase* family. Note that there is no *sage/koi-koi*  decision when a yaku is made; rather, **all hands are fully played out, and any point exchanges for yaku are calculated in conjuction with the points for captured cards.**

## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.
* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player may choose which one they capture.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player ***must*** capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (Brights, Animals, Ribbons, and Chaff) to make assessing the state of the game easier.
{.is-warning}

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion.
## End of Round and Scoring
The round ends once all players have exhausted their hands; at this point, all cards in the deck will have been captured.

Each player's score is calculated as `(captured card points) + (2 x captured yaku points) - (opponents' captured yaku points) - (point burden)`. See below for [card](#card-values) and [yaku](#yaku) values.

The total value of all cards in the deck is 330. However, the **point burden is different for each player**: The **dealer subtracts 100 points from their captured card points**, the **player to their right subtracts 110**, and the **last player subtracts 120**.

**The winner of the round is the one whose score as calculated above is the greatest.** That player becomes the dealer for the next round. 

# End of Game
**After the predetermined number of rounds have elapsed, the winner of the entire game is the player with the highest cumulative score across rounds.**

# Card Values
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Chaff|10|24|
|[![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)|10|2|
|[![monthicon_1.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun), [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon), and [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man)|5|3|
|Animals|5|9|
|Ribbons|1|10|


In an earlier variant of Sudaoshi, the [![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix) were worth 5 points rather than 10, and Chaff were worth 8 points rather than 10, which matches with the card values Jun Kusaba gives for [Kekoro](/en/hanafuda/games/kekoro).
# Yaku
The yaku in Sudaoshi fall into two categories. While any player may score points for the two [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Susuki Grass](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass) yaku, only the last player (the one sitting to the left of the dealer) may score for either [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) yaku.

Note that only one yaku may be captured within each category.

As usual, these yaku may be known by different names depending on the source.

# Variants
- In some variants, only the 2 "Set" yaku are used, not the "Top" ones.
- Since Sudaoshi is often treated as a modification of Hachi-Hachi, the *kan* - 貫 [かん] system is sometimes used, with a rate of either 10 or 12 points per *kan*. In this case, the yaku are set to 1 and 2 *kan* apiece.
- Other gameplay elements of Hachi-Hachi may also show up, such as field multipliers.
