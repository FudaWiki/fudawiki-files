Judan (ジュウダン) is a two-player [Mekuri](/en/mekurifuda/games/mekuri) variant from the city of Echizen in Fukui Prefecture in Japan.

It is traditionally played using Komatsu, a [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda) deck.

The game does not use card points, so players focus on obtaining as many yaku as possible to earn points.

# The Cards
48 cards of a Komatsu deck may be used. Remove the extra “onifuda/bakefuda” from the deck.

## Card Names
Clubs - "Ao"
Swords - "Aka"
Cups - "Chan"
Coins - "Don"

# Game Setup
## Choosing the Dealer and Seating Position
There is no attested method for choosing the dealer, so you may use whichever method suits you.

## Dealing the Initial Cards
7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards face-up to the table. The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

> What happens if 4 cards of the same number/court are dealt to the table has not been attested - usually a misdeal is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture); In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt. Other rules should probably be agreed upon as a house rule.

> Whether or not 4 cards of the same number/court in a player’s hand constitutes as a misdeal has not been attested - the specific answer to this question should probably be agreed upon as a house rule.

# Gameplay
The core gameplay is identical to Hana-awase, except that instead of matching flowers, **numbers/courts** are being matched instead.

**The round ends when all players run out of cards in hand.** All remaining cards in the draw pile and on the field are considered dead cards and will not be used in scoring.

If the round ends without any player forming a yaku, then the round is considered a draw.

> How to deal with a draw situation was not attested. This may be agreed upon by players via a house rule.

# Scoring
All points in the game will come from Dekiyaku.

Each player's yaku points are counted and subtracted by their opponent's yaku points to get the settlement score.

`Settlement score = Player's yaku points - Opponent's yaku points`

Negative score means you lose those points; Positive score means you win those points.

The player who earned more points in that round becomes the dealer for the next round.



# Dekiyaku
All yaku in this list **STACK**.

| Points | Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3 |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1| Club Dragon | Club 2 | Club 3 |
|1| Club 4 | Club 5 | Club 6 |
|5| Club 7 | Club 8 | Club 9 |
|5| Club Maid | Club Horse | Club King |
|2| Sword Dragon | Sword 2 | Sword 3 |
|2| Sword 4 | Sword 5 | Sword 6 |
|10| Sword 7 | Sword 8 | Sword 9 |
|10| Sword Maid | Sword Horse | Sword King |

> Yaku consisting of the higher numbers/courts tend to score higher than those with lower numbers. Also, the Swords suit is twice more valuable than the Clubs suit.

> Since only Clubs and Swords can form yaku, the Cups and Coins suits are considered worthless and are only used for matching the desired cards.
