**Shirinma** [しりんま], also called Shiriuma [シリウマ], is a [Mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda) [game](/en/mekurifuda/games) played by 12 or more players (but not more than 23).

It was attested to be played in the Kokonogi District, Echizen Town, Fukui Prefecture, Japan.

The game features a unique auction gameplay system where other players may bid for the rights to another player's card, so that when that card wins, they get a share of that player's winnings. This was likened to a person riding a horse that is already being ridden by another rider, hence the name **Shiri-uma** [尻馬 - lit. 'rear horse']

# The Cards
48 cards of a **Komatsu** deck is used. Remove the extra onifuda card from the deck.

If you do not have a Komatsu or any mekurifuda deck, you may use a western playing card deck by removing all '10's and jokers from the deck.

## Showdown Cards
All **'1's (Dragons), '10's (Maids), '11's (Horses), and '12's (Kings)** are considered "**showdown cards**". If a player does not have at least one of these cards, they cannot participate in the showdown, and therefore have no chance of winning during that round.

The strength of "showdown cards" are listed below, in descending order:
- **King > Horse > Maid > Dragon**
