Yokohama-bana [横浜花] is a [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant, with simple gambling rules. 

It seems to be a simplification of the game [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), as most of the Teyaku, Dekiyaku, and Special Yaku are also present in that game.

Note that the name may also refer to Hachi-hachi itself, which originated in Yokohama, Japan.

In this game, **3 players** participate in the round at once.

> It has not been attested whether only 3 players play in the game, or if it can be played by more than 3 players using a Join-in/Drop-out system. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**

# Teyaku

|Value (in points)|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|<h2 align="left">Group A: Set Teyaku</h2>|||
|20|**Triplet/Three of a Kind**<br/>三本 [さんぼん, *sanbon*]|Any three cards of the same month.|
|40|**Three Pairs**<br/>喰付 [くっつき, *kuttsuki*] (lit. *sticky?*)|Three pairs of cards- a pair being two cards from the same month.|
|50|**Four of a Kind**<br/>手四 [てし, *teshi*]|Four cards from the same month.|
|50|**Triplet and Two Pairs**<br/>跳剣 [はねけん, *haneken*] (lit. *jumping sword?*)|A Triplet (or Standing Triplet) and two pairs.|

|<h2 align="left">Group B: Chaff Teyaku</h2><br>**Note**: For the purposes of these teyaku, *all* [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards are considered Chaff, as opposed to their usual value. In particular, the Willow Ribbon is not considered a Ribbon.|||
|20|**Red**<br/>赤 [あか, *aka*]|Two or more of any Ribbon card, with Chaff in the remainder of the hand. **Note**: Despite the name, all Ribbon cards count, including the blue ones.|
|20|**One Ribbon**<br/>短一 [たんいち, *tan'ichi*]|One Ribbon card, six Chaff.|

|40|**Empty Hand**<br/>空素 [からす, *karasu*]|Seven Chaff cards.|

The teyaku within each group are mutually exclusive, meaning that **each player scores for their single most valuable teyaku in each of Groups A and B.** In order to claim their *teyaku*, a player must reveal all the relevant cards from their hand: 
* For teyaku in Group A, show all cards that are part of the combination. 
* For teyaku in Group B, only the Chaff cards need to be shown.

>All teyaku payments will be settled during **Card Point Scoring.**

# Dekiyaku
Forming a Dekiyaku **stops the round**. The player is paid shares for the Dekiyaku they formed, and the next round begins.

> It is not attested whether a player may choose to continue the round or not after forming a dekiyaku. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**

# Scoring when Dekiyaku is not Formed
If the round ends and nobody has formed a Dekiyaku, then players must **count their card points**.

## Card Values
The card values used are completely standard, the same as used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi).
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|1|24|

Next, each player must check if they have accomplished a **Special Yaku**. If a Special Yaku is formed, the player is paid shares for that Special Yaku, and the next round begins.

## Special Yaku
For the purposes of these teyaku, *all* [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards are considered Chaff, as opposed to their usual value. In particular, the Willow Ribbon is not considered a Ribbon.
|Value|Name of Yaku|Composition|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|Get 4 shares from each player (Total 8)|**Fourteen Chaff**<br/>[素十四 - すじゅうろく, *sujuushi*]|As the name implies, you must have captured 14 Chaff cards during the round.|
|Get 2 shares from each player (Total 4)|**Dandruff**<br/>フケ役 [ふけやく, *fukeyaku*]|Your card points should total 15 or less.|

If a Special Yaku is not formed, then players proceed with card point scoring.

## Card Point Scoring (Teyaku Settlement)
The card points each player has counted will be their initial score.

Next, if a player has a Teyaku, then he/she receives points equal to the Teyaku value from each of the other two players.

In short, a player's score is calculated as follows:
`Player's Score = Player's Total Card Points + (Total Value of Player's Teyaku x (Number of Players - 1)) - Total Value of All Opponents' Teyaku`

> The sum of all players' card points should always be 264 points.
{.is-info}

Once the Teyaku points have been settled, the player with the **most** points get **1 share each** from the other two players (receive a **total of 2 shares**). The next round then begins.

**The player who received the highest amount of shares in a round becomes the dealer for the next round.**
