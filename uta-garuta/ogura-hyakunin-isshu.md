Hyakunin Isshu (百人一首,'hundred people, one poem each') is a classical Japanese anthology of one hundred Japanese poems (和歌 - *waka*) by one hundred poets. Hyakunin isshu can be translated to "one hundred people, one poem [each]"

The most famous and standard version was compiled by Fujiwara no Teika (1162–1241) while he lived in the Ogura district of Kyoto. It is therefore also known as **Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (小倉百人一首)**.

This particular anthology was adapted into the most famous form of [Uta-garuta](/en/uta-garuta) known today. Nowadays, when Japanese people refer to "karuta", they are most likely refering to this particular card game.

# The Cards
As with many Uta-garuta sets, a set of Hyakunin Isshu Karuta contains two types of cards: **Yomifuda** (読み札, "reading cards") and **Torifuda** (取り札, "grabbing cards").

In Hyakunin Isshu Karuta, There are 100 Yomifuda and 100 Torifuda, for a total of 200 cards per set.

Each **Yomifuda** contains the **name of the poet, and their poem in its entirety**.

> Usually Yomifuda also includes an illustration of the poet at the lower half of the card. In some sets, the illustration is not included in the Yomifuda. Other older sets contain only the first half of the poem instead of the whole thing!

Each corresponding **Torifuda** contains **only the latter half of the poem**, usually written in hiragana without any diacritical marks.

> Some sets, usually special or luxury sets, have both Yomifuda and Torifuda written in cursive Japanese writing.
{.is-info}

# General Premise of the Game
The game is played with **1 person reading the Yomifuda** (hereafter refered to as the **"reader"**), and player(s) competing in the game. 

> Only the players compete in the game. The reader's role is to read the Yomifuda only.
{.is-warning}

A preset number of Torifuda are shuffled and laid on the floor. 

As the reader reads a poem on the Yomifuda, the player(s) must search on the floor the corresponding Torifuda in which the latter half of the poem is written, as quickly as possible.

The objective is to grab as many Torifuda in the game as possible.

# Methods of Playing
## Scatter and Pick up (散らし取り - *Chirashi-Dori*)
This is one of the traditional ways of playing the game, and can be played by any number of players.

> Yes, the game can also be played by one player only. However it is usually for practice purposes only, since it is no longer a competitive game when playing alone. There are also several media available, such as CD's and cassette tapes, which can take the role of the reader in case you could not find someone to read for you.

**Each player plays only for themselves, and the objective is to be the player to grab the most Torifuda.**

The game goes as follows:
- Hand the 100-card Yomifuda deck to the reader.
- Shuffle the 100-card Torifuda deck, and then scatter them on the floor face-up so that everybody can see each card. Ideally the cards are scattered in a circle such that every player has an equal chance to grab every card on the floor.

> You may also line the Torifuda neatly in a grid, if 1 or 2 players are playing.
{.is-info}

- Each player sits around the scattered Tori-fuda.
- The reader draws a Yomifuda from the deck and starts reading it out loud. Players must recognize the poem being read as soon as possible, and race to find and grab the corresponding Torifuda.
- The first player to grab the correct Torifuda takes the Torifuda.
- After the Torifuda is taken, the reader proceeds to draw and read the next Yomifuda.
- The game continues until all Yomifuda are read and all Torifuda are taken. 
- Players count the Torifuda they have taken. The player with the most Torifuda wins the game.

## Reversed Karuta (逆さまかるた - *Sakasama Karuta*)
The gameplay and number of players are identical to "Scatter and Pick Up", except that the **Yomifuda are used as Torifuda, and the Torifuda are used as Yomifuda**.

The reader only reads the latter half of the poems, and players must grab the cards on the floor, based on the corresponding first half of the poem. However, since the cards on the floor are written in kana mixed with kanji (chinese characters), the game is characterized by optical illusions that make it easy to grab the wrong card.

It seems the original purpose of this game is for practice purposes, by familiarizing with the first half of the poems by listening only to the latter half of the poems being read.

## Genpei War (源平合戦 - *Genpei-Gassen*)
It is a competition between two teams of one or more players per team.
The two teams are called Genji (源氏) and Heiji (平氏).

Each team sits on the opposite sides, and in between them the Torifuda are laid neatly: 50 cards near the Genji side and 50 cards near the Heiji side.
They are arranged in three rows: 17 cards at the bottom row, 17 cards at the middle row, and 16 cards at the top row.

The gameplay is the same as "Scatter and Pick Up"; players can grab Torifuda on either side.

Since it is a team battle, there are some rules:
- If a player grabs a Torifuda from the opponent's side, then they move one Torifuda from their own side to the opponent's side.
- If a player takes the wrong Torifuda, then the opponent moves one of their Torifuda to the player's side as a penalty.
- The team who has no more Torifuda on their side wins the game.
