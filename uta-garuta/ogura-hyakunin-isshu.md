Hyakunin Isshu (百人一首, 'hundred people, one poem each') is a classical Japanese anthology of one hundred Japanese poems (和歌 - *waka*) by one hundred poets.

The most famous and standard version was compiled by Fujiwara no Teika (1162–1241) while he lived in the Ogura district of Kyoto. It is therefore also known as **Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (小倉百人一首)**.

This particular anthology was adapted into the most famous form of [Uta-garuta](/en/uta-garuta) known today. Nowadays, when Japanese people refer to "karuta", they are most likely refering to this particular card game.

# The Cards
As with many Uta-garuta sets, a set of Hyakunin Isshu Karuta contains two types of cards: **Yomifuda** (読み札, "reading cards") and **Torifuda** (取り札, "grabbing cards").

In Hyakunin Isshu Karuta, There are 100 Yomifuda and 100 Torifuda, for a total of 200 cards per set.

Each **Yomifuda** contains the **name of the poet, and their poem in its entirety**.

> Usually Yomifuda also includes an illustration of the poet at the lower half of the card. In some sets, the illustration is not included in the Yomifuda. Other older sets contain only the first half of the poem instead of the whole thing!
{.is-info}

Each corresponding **Torifuda** contains **only the latter half of the poem**, usually written in hiragana without any diacritical marks.

> Some sets, usually special or luxury sets, have both Yomifuda and Torifuda written in cursive Japanese writing.
{.is-info}

# General Premise of the Game
The game is played with **1 person reading the Yomifuda** (hereafter refered to as the **"reader"**), and player(s) competing in the game. 

> Only the players compete in the game. The reader's role is to read the Yomifuda only.
{.is-warning}

A preset number of Torifuda are shuffled and laid on the floor. 

As the reader reads a poem on the Yomifuda, the player(s) must search on the floor the corresponding Torifuda in which the latter half of the poem is written, as quickly as possible.

> It is a great advantage if you have memorized the poems before playing the game.
{.is-warning}

The objective is to grab as many Torifuda in the game as possible.

# Methods of Playing
## Scatter and Pick up (散らし取り - *Chirashi-Dori*)
This is one of the traditional ways of playing the game, and can be played by any number of players.

> Yes, the game can also be played by one player only. However it is usually for practice purposes only, since it is no longer a competitive game when playing alone. There are also several media available, such as CD's and cassette tapes, which can take the role of the reader in case you could not find someone to read for you.
{.is-info}

**Each player plays only for themselves, and the objective is to be the player to grab the most Torifuda.**

The game goes as follows:
- Hand the 100-card Yomifuda deck to the reader.
- Shuffle the 100-card Torifuda deck, and then scatter them on the floor face-up so that everybody can see each card. Ideally the cards are scattered in a circle such that every player has an equal chance to grab every card on the floor.

> You may also line the Torifuda neatly in a grid, if 1 or 2 players are playing.
{.is-info}

- Each player sits around the scattered Tori-fuda.
- The reader draws a Yomifuda from the deck and starts reading it out loud. Players must recognize the poem being read as soon as possible, and race to find and grab the corresponding Torifuda.
- The first player to grab the correct Torifuda takes the Torifuda.
- After the Torifuda is taken, the reader proceeds to draw and read the next Yomifuda.
- The game continues until all Yomifuda are read and all Torifuda are taken. 
- Players count the Torifuda they have taken. The player with the most Torifuda wins the game.

## Reversed Karuta (逆さまかるた - *Sakasama Karuta*)
The gameplay and number of players are identical to "Scatter and Pick Up", except that the **Yomifuda are used as Torifuda, and the Torifuda are used as Yomifuda**.

The reader only reads the latter half of the poems, and players must grab the cards on the floor, based on the corresponding first half of the poem. However, since the cards on the floor are written in kana mixed with kanji (chinese characters), the game is characterized by optical illusions that make it easy to grab the wrong card.

It seems the original purpose of this game is for practice purposes, by familiarizing with the first half of the poems by listening only to the latter half of the poems being read.

## Genpei War (源平合戦 - *Genpei-Gassen*)
It is a competition between two teams of one or more players per team.
The two teams are called Genji (源氏) and Heiji (平氏).

Each team sits on the opposite sides, and in between them the Torifuda are laid neatly: 50 cards near the Genji side and 50 cards near the Heiji side.
The Torifuda on each side are arranged in three rows: 17 cards at the bottom row, 17 cards at the middle row, and 16 cards at the top row.

The gameplay is the same as "Scatter and Pick Up"; players can grab Torifuda on either side.

Since it is a team battle, there are some rules:
- If a player grabs a Torifuda from the opponent's side, then they move one Torifuda from their own side to the opponent's side.
- If a player takes the wrong Torifuda, then the opponent moves one of their Torifuda to the player's side as a penalty.
- The team who has no more Torifuda on their side wins the game.

## Relay Karuta (リレーかるた - 'Relay Karuta')

It is a variant of Genpei War where:
- Each team member play in turns instead of all at once.
- Turnover of players of both teams occur every 10 poems read.
- If an opponent took a Torifuda from a player's side, the player passes their turn to their next teammate.

## Competitive Karuta (競技かるた - *Kyōgi Karuta*)
[Competitive Karuta](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu/competitive-karuta) is a full-fledged competition held under the rules set by the All Japan Karuta Association. 

It is a one-on-one game characterized by using **only 50 Torifuda**, which is half of what is used in "Scatter and Pick up". However, all 100 Yomifuda are read by the reader.

Playing at a competitive level requires a high level of dexterity, agility, and memory, and is considered as a kind of sport in Japan.

# Other Games using Hyakunin Isshu Karuta
## Mubeyama Karuta (むべ山かるた)
[Mubeyama Karuta](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu/mubeyama-karuta) is a bingo-style gambling game that was very popular from the mid-Edo period to the Meiji period.

The torifuda are divided equally between a preset number of players, who then arrange them neatly in rows. The reader reads the Yomifuda, and the player must then check their cards if they have the corresponding Torifuda. If they do, they flip it face-down. A player is paid points for either completing a row of Torifuda, or flipping a Torifuda of special "yaku" poems, which contain certain words.

The game is named after a "yaku" poem in the game, which is written by Fun'ya no Yasuhide:

**#22**

|Japanese|Romaji|English|
|:---|:---|:---|
|吹くからに</br>秋の草木の</br>しをるれば</br></br>**むべ山**風を</br>あらしといふらむ|*Fuku kara ni*</br>*Aki no kusaki no*</br>*Shiorureba*</br></br>***Mube yama** kaze o*</br>*Arashi to iuran*|It is by its breath</br>That autumn's leaves of trees and grass</br>Are wasted and driven.</br></br>So they call this mountain wind</br>The wild one, the destroyer.|

## Bōzu Mekuri (坊主めくり, "flip the baldies")
Bōzu-mekuri seems to have been devised as a game that even children who have not memorized the poems can play, but it is not clear when and where it originated or who invented it.

Only the 100 Yomifuda of a [Hyakunin Isshu](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) set are used. They are placed in **a face-down stack on the table**.

Any number of players may play the game. After the first player is decided using rock-paper-scissors or any other method, players sit around the face-down stack. Turn moves counter-clockwise, starting with the first player previously mentioned.

**Each player draws one card from the stack**, and depending on the drawn card, an effect will take place, then the player's turn ends and the player to their right takes their turn. The game ends when the face-down stack runs out of cards. The player with the most cards in hand wins the game.

The common rules are as follows:
- If the card drawn is a **man**, **keep it in your hand**.
- If the card drawn has a **bald head** (i.e. a monk/priest), **put this card along with all cards in your hand onto the table face-up as the "pot"**.
- If the card drawn is a **woman**, **keep it in your hand, and take all cards in the pot.**
- If the card drawn is **Semimaru** (蝉丸), then **you are disqualified from the game**.

### Regional Rules
Some regional rules are listed below. *Decide first before applying these rules in the game*:
- Instead of just one face-down stack, it is split into **multiple face-down stacks**, and a player may draw a card from any one of these stacks.
- If the card drawn is a **woman**, and the **pot is empty**, then **keep the card in your hand and draw another card.**
- If the card drawn is from the **Imperial Family (Emperor/Prince)**, then **keep it in your hand and draw multiple cards.**
- If the card drawn is from the **Imperial Family (Emperor/Prince)**, then **keep it in your hand and take all cards from all players' hands.**
- If the card drawn is **on an elevated platform**, then **keep it in your hand and draw another card.**
- If the card drawn is **Semimaru** (蝉丸), then **all players' hands are placed into the pot**.
- **Semimaru** (蝉丸) has the same effect as a card with a **bald** person on it.

## Ao Kanmuri (青冠, 'blue crown')
The game is played by 2 teams of 2 players per team. Only the 100 Yomifuda of a [Hyakunin Isshu](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) set are used. 

The game goes as follows:
- All players sit around in a circle. Teammates sit facing each other.
- Deal 25 cards to each player's hand.
- Determine the first player using any method you prefer. Turns move counterclockwise starting with the first player.
- The first player puts out one card on the table as an "attack".
-- If the next player has a card of the same type as the attack card (or if they have a card that defeats the attack card), they "receive" the attack by putting it on the attack card. Then they place another card on the table as an "attack".
-- If the next player doesn't have a card of the same type, or if they don't feel like "receiving" it, then they pass the turn to the next player.
- The game continues until one team runs out of cards in hand. That team wins the game.

**Cards are classified into different types:**
- Emperor Tenchi - defeats all cards.
- Emperor Jito - defeats all cards except Emperor Tenchi.
- Bald (Monk/Priest)
- Woman
- Man wearing Yagoro (Arrow)
- Man wearing vertical eboshi
- Man wearing horizontal eboshi
- Man wearing a black/colored crown
