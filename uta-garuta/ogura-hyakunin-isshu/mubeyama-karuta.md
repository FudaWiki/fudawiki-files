Mubeyama Karuta is a bingo-style gambling game using [Hyakunin Isshu Karuta](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) from the Okayama prefecture in Japan, that was very popular from the mid-Edo period to the Meiji period.

The game is named after the following poem written by Fun'ya no Yasuhide:

**#22 Fun'ya no Yasuhide**

|Japanese|Romaji|English|
|:---|:---|:---|
|吹くからに</br>秋の草木の</br>しをるれば</br></br>**むべ山**風を</br>あらしといふらむ|*Fuku kara ni*</br>*Aki no kusaki no*</br>*Shiorureba*</br></br>***Mube yama** kaze o*</br>*Arashi to iuran*|It is by its breath</br>That autumn's leaves of trees and grass</br>Are wasted and driven.</br></br>So they call this mountain wind</br>The wild one, the destroyer.|

Originally, the game was created during the Genroku era as an elegant way of playing Hyakunin Isshu karuta, without using fast reflexes like in the typical method of playing the game.

Eventually, the game was adapted for gambling, and some time later in the Edo period, card makers were manufacturing special sets designed specifically for playing Mubeyama Karuta.

# Premise of the Game
The game is played with **1 person reading the Yomifuda** (hereafter refered to as the **"reader"**), and players competing in the game. 

> Only the players compete in the game. The reader's role is to read the Yomifuda only.
{.is-warning}

The Torifuda are divided equally between a preset number of players, who then arrange them neatly in rows. 

The reader reads the Yomifuda, and the player must then check their cards if they have the corresponding Torifuda. If they do, they flip it face-down. 

> The reader must double-check if a player has flipped the corresponding Torifuda before reading the next Yomifuda.
{.is-warning}

A player is paid points for either completing a row of Torifuda, or flipping a Torifuda of special "yaku" poems, which contain certain words.

There are many different configurations of this game, depending on the attested ruleset.

# Methods of Playing
## Okayama Prefecture
This is one the oldest variations of this game, and also resembles Bingo the most.

The game can be played by 4 or 6 players.

When playing with 4 players, each player is given 25 Torifuda, arranged face-up in a 5x5 grid.
When playing with 6 players, each player is given 16 Torifuda, arranged face-up in a 4x4 grid.

> There will be 4 Torifuda left unused in a 6 player game.
{.is-warning}

The reader draws a Yomifuda from the deck and starts reading it out loud. Players must recognize the poem being read, and check their cards if they have the corresponding Torifuda. If they do, they flip it face-down.

A player wins if a **line of Torifuda are flipped face-down**. It can be **vertical, horizontal, or diagonal**, just like in Bingo.

There are no "yaku" poems in this ruleset.

## Izumoji family "Mubeyama Asobi"
This was recorded in 1952 by Keikazu Izumoji, a descendant of the Izumoji family of Shinto priests in Kyoto.

The game can be played by 5 or 6 players.

When playing with 5 players, each player is given 20 Torifuda, arranged neatly by the player.
When playing with 6 players, each player is given 16 Torifuda, arranged neatly by the player.

> There will be 4 Torifuda left unused in a 6 player game.
{.is-warning}

The gameplay is the same as in the Okayama version, however, instead of aiming to form a line of face-down cards, players aim to place **all of their cards face-down**. So in this regard, it resembles Blackout Bingo more than it does regular Bingo.

However, the interesting part of this game are the "yaku" poems. These are poems whose latter half of the poem contain specific words or phrases (with exception of poems #1 and #100). They are considered powerful in this game, because they allow players to pass their Torifuda to other players.

### Yaku Poem Set 1 (pass to the right)
"Yaku" poems in this set include those whose Torifuda contain the following key words:
|Japanese</br>(*Romaji*, 'English')|[Poem number](https://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/hyakunin/frames/hyakuframes.html)|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**人** - ひと</br>(*hito*, 'person')|#8, #11, #18, #25, #28, #38, **#39**, #40, #41, #44, #47, #58, #63, **#66**, #92|
|**恋** - こい</br>(*koi*, 'love')|#13, #27, **#39**, #46, #65, **#68**, #84, #88|
|**関** - せき</br>(*seki*, 'gate')|#10, #62, #78|
|**雪** - ゆき</br>(*yuki*, 'snow')|#4, #15, #31, #96|
|**月** - つき</br>(*tsuki*, 'moon')|#7, #21, #36, #57, #59, **#68**, #79, #81|
|**花** - はな</br>(*hana*, 'flower')|#29, #33, #35, **#66**|

> Editor's note: Supposedly there are only **28 Torifuda** with the above key words, but it sees that I have found more. Probably only some of these poems are used in the game. **NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION**
{.is-warning}

- If a player flips a Torifuda that contains **one of the above key words**, that player **passes one face-up Torifuda to the player on their right**. 

- If a player flips a Torifuda that is either of the **poem #1** ("Aki no ta no...") or **poem #100** ("Momoshiki ya..."), that player **passes one face-up Torifuda to the player on their right**. 

- If a player flips a Torifuda that contains **two of the above key words**, that player **passes two face-up Torifuda to the player on their right**. These cards include those of poems **#39, #66, and #68**.

### Yaku Poem Set 2 - (pass to everyone)
The theme of this set is **Mountains**, and the Torifuda contain the following key phrases:

|Japanese</br>(*Romaji*, 'English')|[Poem number](https://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/hyakunin/frames/hyakuframes.html)|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**富士の高嶺に** - ふじのたかねに</br>(*Fuji no takane ni*, 'on Fuji's peak')|#4|
|**三笠の山に** - みかさのやみに</br>(*Mikasa no yama ni*, 'on Mount Mikasa')|#7|
|**をとめの姿** - をとめのすがた</br>(*otome no sugata*, 'maiden's appearance')|#12|
|**外山の霞** - とやまのかすみ</br>(*toyama no kasumi*, 'Toyama mountain mist')|#73|
|**むべ山風を** - むべやまかぜを</br>(*mubeyama kaze wo*, 'Mubeyama mountain wind')|**#22**|

- If a player flips a Torifuda that is either of the **poem #4, #7, #12, or #73**, that player **passes one face-up Torifuda to each of the other players.**

- If a player flips a Torifuda of the **poem #22** (the one which contains the phrase "Mubeyama kaze wo..."), that player **passes two face-up Torifuda to each of the other players.**. This is regarded as the most powerful Yaku poem in the game since you pass many cards away from your table, which will make victory easier to achieve.

### Yaku Poem Set 3 (receive from everyone)
Unlike the first 2 Yaku poem sets which are advantageous, the Yaku poems in the 3rd set are **disadvantageous** to the player who flip the Torifuda.

The theme of this set is **Sadness**, and the Torifuda contain the following words:

|Japanese</br>(*Romaji*, 'English')|[Poem number](https://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/hyakunin/frames/hyakuframes.html)|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**泣く** -  なく</br>(*naku*, 'cry')|#14, #34, #83|
|**悲し** - かなし</br>(*kanashi*, 'sadness')|**#5**, #93|
|**涙** - なみだ</br>(*namida*, 'tears')|**#82, #86**|

- If a player flips a Torifuda that contains the words "naku", "kanashi", and "namida", that player **receives one face-up Torifuda from each of the other players.**

>Note that only poems #5, #82, and #86 contain the actual words in their original meaning, while in poems #14, #34, #83, and #93, the words only appear in a pun.
