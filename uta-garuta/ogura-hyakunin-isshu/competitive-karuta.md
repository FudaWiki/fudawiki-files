Kyōgi karuta (競技かるた, 'Competitive Karuta') is a full-fledged [Hyakunin Isshu Karuta](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) competition held under the rules set by the All Japan Karuta Association.

Playing at a competitive level requires a high level of various skills: dexterity, agility, and memory. Even a millisecond could be the difference between taking a card and losing it, which is why it is considered as a kind of sport in Japan.

# Premise
The game is similar to the ["Genpei War"](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu#genpei-war-%E6%BA%90%E5%B9%B3%E5%90%88%E6%88%A6-genpei-gassen) method of playing Hyakunin Isshu, except:
- The game is for 2 players only.
- Only 50 cards of the Torifuda are used, but all 100 Yomifuda are read. This results in situations where the reader reads a poem whose Torifuda is not on the floor, during which touching any Torifuda is considered a fault.
- The Torifuda on the floor are required to be neatly arranged in a specific manner.
- The reader recites a poem that is not found in Hyakunin Isshu during the start of the game.
- The rules for faults are slightly different from that in "Genpei War".

# Setup
The game is a 1-versus-1 battle, facilitated by the reader and the judge.

The stack of 100 Yomifuda are held by the reader.

The players sit facing each other, with the stack of 100 Torifuda placed face-down between them.

## Choosing the Torifuda
As courtesy, players bow to each other, saying "Yoroshiku onegaishimasu".

The Torifuda are then wash-shuffled on the floor, keeping all cards face-down.

After the Torifuda are shuffled well, each player takes 25 Torifuda. 
The remaining 50 Torifuda, called Karafuda ('empty cards') are set aside and not used in the game.

## Arranging the Territories
Each player then arranges their Torifuda on the floor face-up. This would become their "Territory".

There are rules for arranging the Territory:
- A player's territory should be **3cm (or about 3 fingers width) away from your opponent's territory**.
- In a player's territory, the cards should be arranged in **3 rows** that are **1cm (or about 1 finger width) apart**.
- The **width of the territory should be 87cm (about the width of 16.5 cards)**. Any number of Torifuda may be placed on the left and right sides of each row. They may also place Torifuda in the middle of the row.

Considering the rules above, a player may arrange your Torifuda in any order they want. The goal is to arrange them in a manner that they could easily remember the location of each card in their territory.
