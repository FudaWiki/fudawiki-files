**Karuta** [骨牌 - かるた] is a general term for Japanese-style playing cards (as opposed to *toranpu*, Western-style playing cards). These fall into a wide array of categories and subcategories, some of which are detailed below.

> The term *karuta* is also often used specifically in reference to the competitive game of [Hyakunin-Isshu](/en/hyakunin-isshu).
