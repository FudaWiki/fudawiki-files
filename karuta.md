**Karuta** [骨牌 - かるた] is a general term for Japanese-style playing cards (as opposed to *toranpu*, Western-style playing cards). These fall into a wide array of categories and subcategories, some of which are detailed below.

> The term *karuta* is also often used specifically in reference to the competitive game of [Hyakunin-Isshu](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu).

Unlike Western-style playing cards, which are thin and can be bent to a degree without damaging the cards, Karuta are usually thick, and made up of several layers of paper glued together, which are wrapped together with an even bigger sheet of paper that also forms the borders of the front of the cards. Because of this, it is impossible to bend the cards without damaging them, and are treated more like tiles than cards.

# Two Major Families of Karuta
Karuta sets are classified into two major families:
- **E-awase** (絵合わせ, 'picture-matching' or 'card-matching') - these are Karuta that has its roots on the Heian-period (794-1185) game of [Kai-Ooi](/en/kai-ooi) [貝覆い, 'shell covering'], which was originally a game played by the noble class. The adaptation of the game into karuta brought the game to the masses. The gameplay generally involves matching pairs of cards, or matching a certain type of card with its equivalent other type of card.

- **Portuguese Deck derivatives** - these are Karuta that are based on the Portuguese playing card decks that were introduced by the Portuguese to Japan in the 1540's. They are usually used for gambling and were subject to bans during the Sakoku (1603-1868).

## Sets belonging to E-awase
|Type|Characteristics|
|---|:---|
|[Uta-garuta](/en/uta-garuta)|A sub-family of E-awase that involves poetry. Usually the two halves of poems are split into two cards.|
|[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu)|200 cards - Two decks of 100 cards each. One deck's *yomifuda* [reading cards] each contain a *waka* poem and a depiction of the poet; the other deck's *torifuda* [grabbing cards] only contain the second half of the poem depicted on one card from the first deck. This belongs to a wider family of [Uta-Garuta](/en/uta-garuta), poetry cards. The *yomifuda* are also sometimes used to play [other games](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu#other-games-using-hyakunin-isshu-karuta) not involving poetry.|
|[Iroha-Karuta](/en/iroha)|96 cards - Two decks of 48 cards each. Essentially a simpler variant of Uta-Garuta. Each card in the first deck features a (usually *hiragana*) character, and each card in the second deck contains a proverb or quote beginning with a character from the first deck.|
|[Dosai Karuta](/en/unsun)|A card set similar to Iroha Karuta in that its theme revolves around proverbs, however, the *torifuda* do not have any syllables on them. Originally a family-friendly game, it was eventually used to play a gambling game similar to bingo.|
|Hana-awase|The ancestor of Hanafuda (not to be confused with the [game](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) of the same name). Each set has a maximum of 400 cards. Originally having 100 types of flowers, each flower appears in four cards: One of which also has a tanzaku on it, and one of which has a bird, animal, or object on it. Later sets would gradually be reduced in number of cards, until it was finally reduced to just 48 cards.|
|[Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda)|Generally 48 cards, with some exceptions. 12 [suits](/en/hanafuda/suits) of 4 cards each, of varying [types](/en/hanafuda/types) depending on the suit. They feature somewhat abstracted depictions of culturally relevant flora and fauna pairings, with each suit represented by a species of plant. Originally belonging to a wide family of [E-awase](/en/e-awase) (picture matching cards), Hanafuda was adapted to play a [wide variety of games](/en/hanafuda/games), including those played with other types of cards.|
|[Junishi-Awase](/en/junishi-awase)|48 cards - Consists of 4 cards for each of the 12 Chinese Zodiac Animals. May be in either Menko or Playing Card format. Each card has points written on them, which vary depending on the manufacturer.|
|[Garafuda](/en/garafuda)|140 cards with illustrations on them, and 140 sticks with the names of the corresponding cards written on them. Sometimes, there are additional sticks with markings that are worth additional points. Used to play a lottery game of the same name.|


## Sets derived from Portuguese cards
|Type|Characteristics|
|---|:---|
|Tensho Karuta|The predecessor of Mekuri Karuta, and described as a faithful recreation of the original Portuguese playing cards. They were widely popular in Japan prior to the banning of Portuguese playing cards. Likewise, they can be used to play a similar [variety of games](/en/mekurifuda/games) to their *toranpu* and hanafuda relatives.|
|[Unsun Karuta](/en/unsun)|75 cards. 5 suits of 15 cards each. Primarily associated with the 8-player trick-taking game [Hachi-Nin Meri](/en/karuta/unsun/hachi-nin-meri).|
|[Sunkun Karuta](/en/sunkun)|96 cards + 1 portuguese dragon (joker). 6 suits of 16 cards each.
|[Mekuri Karuta](/en/mekurifuda)|Generally 48 cards. 4 suits of 12 cards each, with each card in hierarichical order from 1 to 12. The 10, 11, and 12s are generally court cards, though often extremely obscured by abstraction. They feature the same suits as their Portuguese predecessors - swords [*isu*], batons [*hau*], coins [*ouru*], and cups [*kotsu*]. Mekuri karuta come in a wide variety of [regional variants](/en/mekurifuda#kinds-of-mekurifuda), and can be used to play a similar [variety of games](/en/mekurifuda/games) to their *toranpu* and hanafuda relatives.|
|[Kabufuda](/en/kabufuda)|40 cards. Four copies each of numbers 1 through 10, mostly represented by abstract black stripes, ultimately derived from the Portuguese suit of batons. The Aces are abstracted from dragons and the 10s are "court" cards, though the subject depicted has changed over time from a monk to a Jack. Primarily used to play [certain gambling games](/en/kabufuda/games) of the *kabu* and *kingo* genres. This belongs to a family of [One-suited Karuta](/en/one-suited-mekurifuda-variants).|
|[Tehonbiki](/en/tehonbiki)|3 types of cards are used: Harifuda (handled by the players), Hikifuda (handled by the banker), and Mefuda (large wooden tiles, also handled by the banker).
