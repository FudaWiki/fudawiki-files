Hachi-Nin Meri (八人メリ, "eight people *meri*") is a trick-taking game played in Hitoyoshi city, in the island of Kyushu in Japan.

It is thought of to be related to the European game, Ombre.

It is designed to be played by 8 players, as **2 teams of 4 players each**.

# The deck
A complete deck of Unsun Karuta is used.

This deck contains 5 suits, with 15 cards per suit, for a total of **75 cards**.

## Suits
Suits are categorized into 2 groups: **Long Suits and Round Suits**. 
- The Long suits are: Clubs and Swords.
- The Round suits are: Cups, Coins, and Drums.

>The groups correspond to Black Suits and Red Suits of Western Playing Cards respectively.

## Numbers and Courts
The sequence of numbers are described as follows:
- For Long Suits (Clubs and Swords), increasing number (1-9) means increasing value.
- For **Round Suits** (Cups, Coins, and Drums), **decreasing number (9-1)** means **increasing value**.

In any suit, the courts are more valueable than the number cards.

The courts, in increasing value, are: 
|Value|Japanese Name|English Name|Depiction|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|10|Robai|Dragon|A dragon (may be Portuguese or Chinese)|
|11|Sota|Maid|A woman|
|12|Uma|Horse|A knight or horseman riding a horse|
|13|Kiri|King|A Samurai|
|14|Un|God|One of the Seven Lucky Gods|
|15|Sun|Chinese|A Chinese official wearing a *futou*|

# Game Composition
Unsun Karuta is a trick-taking game.
There are 9 Hands per round, and there are 8 rounds per game.
A whole session of Unsun Karuta is played in best of 3 games. The team who won two games wins the entire session.

# OBJECTIVE
The objective is for each team to get as many tricks as possible (each trick is 1 point), as well as obtain yaku for extra points.

# SETUP
Eight people split into two teams of four players each. The teams are called Genji and Heiji.

The two teams sit alternately; on a round table, each player must be facing a team-mate, and must be seated in between two players from the opposing team.
Decide who is the dealer. (There is no recommended method of choosing dealer; decide as you wish.)

After the round ends, the dealer for the next round will be the player to the dealer’s left.

# SELECTING THE LEADER
Step 1: Dealer cuts the deck into 2 piles, shuffles each pile, and deals 9 cards to each player. 
The last 3 cards are put as a stack on the table face-down.

Step 2: The top card of the stack is turned face-up. This card becomes the “Large Trump”, which will determine the trump suit. 
Cards of the same suit as the Large Trump are called “trump” cards; Cards not of the same suit as the Large Trump are called “non-trump” cards. 

Step 3: Each player looks at their hand for a Dragon of the same suit as the Large Trump.
The player who has a Dragon trump card declares “I have the dragon!”, and takes the Trump into his/her hand. The player now has 10 cards in hand.
Whether or not the player declares his/her Dragon trump card is up to the player. He/she may also decide to “Hide the Dragon” by not declaring it. (In that case, some Yaku will increase in value (see Yaku below). This is mainly played by the losing team to turn the tables into their favor)
There is also a case when nobody has a Dragon trump card, because it is in one of the face-down cards in the stack. In that case, nobody can declare to have a Dragon trump card.
If nobody declares to have a Dragon trump card, or if the Large Trump is a Dragon, then the dealer takes the Trump into his/her hand.
Step 4: The player who took the Large Trump becomes the Leader of the round, and for his/her first turn, he/she begins the Opening Lead.

# 1st HAND OPENING LEAD 
Step 1: The leader chooses a card from his/her hand that he/she wants to play on the first trick, and places it on the table near him/her face-down.
Step 2: The leader places another card from his/her hand face-down which he/she doesn’t need.
Step 3: The leader places the remaining two face-down cards on top of the discarded stack.
Step 4: The leader finally flips this stack of four cards right side up.
The card that the leader has played is revealed, on top of the face-up stack. (When the trick is taken, all 4 cards of the stack are taken also.)
Note that in any Hand other than the 1st one, the Opening Lead is done by the leader by playing any card from his/her hand.

# TRICK PHASE (There are 9 tricks per round)
After the opening lead, each player plays 1 card from the hand. Turns move in clockwise order.
At this time, there is no obligation to follow the suit played by the previous player until the "Meri" and "Monchi" tricks described below. You can play any cards you like.

Trump cards must be played face-down; non-trump cards must be played face-up. (Except during “Meri”)
Sometimes, a player who has played a trump card is followed by another player who plays another trump card, and another one, etc.… These successive trump cards are checked during the decision phase to see if a Yaku is formed.
Also, if a player has a Dragon of Clubs, it is always considered a trump card regardless of the suit of the Large Trump. This card must always be played face-down. (Except during “Meri”)

When all 8 players have played their card, the trick phase is over and the winner of the trick will be decided in the showdown.

# SHOWDOWN  (After every end of trick)
## Situation 1
If nobody played a trump card, the player with the strongest non-trump card wins and that player’s team takes the trick (the stack of all cards played during the trick phase). Each trick is worth 1 point.
### STRENGTH OF NON-TRUMP CARDS IN GENERAL:
1.	Chinese 
2.	Gods
3.	Kings
4.	Knights
5.	Maids
6.	Dragons except Dragon of Clubs
7.	Strongest number card to weakest number card. 
For Long suits, 9 is strongest, 1 is weakest.
For Round suits, 1 is strongest, 9 is weakest.
However, if the Large Trump is any suit other than Swords, the Dragon of Swords is considered a number card “1.5” (i.e., with a strength between a 2 of swords and 1 of swords)

### STRENGTH OF NON-TRUMP CARDS PER SUIT:
Clubs			: Chinese, God, King, Knight, Maid, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Swords			: Chinese, God, King, Knight, Maid, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Dragon, 1
Cups, Coins, Drums	: Chinese, God, King, Knight, Maid, Dragon, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Note that the Dragon of Clubs isn’t included; it is always considered a trump card regardless of the suit of the Large Trump.

### STRENGTH OF NON-TRUMP CARDS PER SUIT (IF THE LARGE TRUMP IS SWORDS):
Clubs			: Chinese, God, King, Knight, Maid, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Swords			: Chinese, God, King, Knight, Maid, Dragon, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Cups, Coins, Drums	: Chinese, God, King, Knight, Maid, Dragon, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

## Situation 2
If one player played a trump card, that player flips it over to reveal to other players that it is indeed a trump card. That player wins, and that player’s team takes the trick. 

## Situation 3
If two or more players played a trump card, those players reveal their cards. The player with the strongest “trump” card wins and takes the trick.
### STRENGTH OF TRUMP CARDS IN GENERAL:
1.	Chinese
2.	Gods
3.	Maids
4.	Dragon of Clubs
5.	Other Dragons
6.	Kings
7.	Knights
8.	Strongest number card to weakest number card. 
For Long suits, 9 is strongest, 1 is weakest.
For Round suits, 1 is strongest, 9 is weakest.
Note that the Dragon of Clubs ranks higher than other Dragons.
However, if the suit of the Large Trump is Clubs, then the Dragon of Clubs is of the same strength as the other dragons.

### STRENGTH OF TRUMP CARDS PER SUIT:
Clubs		      : Chinese, God, Maid, Dragon, King, Knight, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Swords		      : Chinese, God, Maid, Dragon of Clubs, Dragon, King, Knight, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Cups, Coins, Drums: Chinese, God, Maid, Dragon of Clubs, Dragon, King, Knight, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

### STRENGTH OF TRUMP CARDS PER SUIT (IF THE LARGE TRUMP IS CLUBS):
Clubs		      : Chinese, God, Maid, Dragon, King, Knight, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Swords		      : Chinese, God, Maid, Dragon, King, Knight, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Cups, Coins, Drums: Chinese, God, Maid, Dragon, King, Knight, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

If Yaku is formed by the winner, that player’s team gets additional points depending on the Yaku formed. These points are tabulated.

The winner of the trick becomes the leader during the next trick phase. (The card played by the leader will determine if the trick is “Meri”, “Monchi”, or neither.)
After 9 tricks have been taken (and all hands run out of cards), the round ends.

# MERI
In any Hand except the first one, when the leader plays a trump card, the trick is considered “Meri”. 

In this case, each of the following players MUST play a trump card face-up on their turn if they have one on their hand.
If you don’t have a trump card, you can play any card, but you will lose the trick, of course.
Also, if at the beginning of the round, you only have one trump card in your hand and it’s a Chinese, then you don’t have to play it during “Meri”.
After the “Meri” trick is taken, the remaining tricks are “Monchi”. There can only be one “Meri” trick in the entire round.

Note: If the leader plays a trump card during the Opening Lead, it doesn’t count as “Meri”.

# MONCHI
After the “Meri” trick is taken, the remaining tricks are “Monchi” until the round ends.
During “Monchi”, Each of the following players after the “launch” must either play a card of the same suit as the “launched” card face-up, or play a trump card face-down.

# YAKU
A yaku is formed when it is not Meri and players play trump cards in succession (the winner is the one who put out "Otta!"), or when of the following conditions is met:
When the winner puts out "Sun" and beats the opponent's "Un".
When the winner puts out "Un" and beats the opponent's "Sota".
When the winner puts out "Sota" and beats the opponent's "Robai".
When the winner puts out "Robai" and beats the opponent's "Rei".
When the winner gives a "2" and wins the opponent's "1". (When trump card is a long suit)
When the winner gives an "8" and wins the opponent's "9". (When trump card is a round suit)

Restrictions:
It doesn’t count if you win against your own teammate.
It also doesn’t count if a trump card higher than the trump used to beat another trump card in a Yaku is already present during the showdown before the Yaku was revealed.

## YAKU SCORING
Each "yaku" is worth 2 tricks.
Furthermore, if a Yaku is made during the 9th round, then the hand is not worth 2 tricks, but 5 tricks.

If the game is played with a hidden dragon :
When the winner puts out "Sota" and beats the opponent's "Robai". Take 5 tricks.
When the winner puts out "Robai" and beats the opponent's "Rei". Take 5 tricks.
If the yaku is made during the 9th round, it still is worth 5 tricks.

# WINNING THE GAME
One deal of 9 rounds is called "hitomaki," and the score for "hitomaki" is the difference in the number of tricks earned. Therefore, the basic score is 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, plus the additional trick value for any "yaku".
Once a deal “hitomaki” is finished, the next dealer is the player to the previous dealer’s left.
A full game consists of 8 “hitomaki” (i.e. all players have become dealer), and is called “hitokiri”. The team with highest points in the full game is the winner of one “hitokiri” game.
Unsun Karuta is played for best of 3 games (“honkatsu”). If a team wins the first two games, it is called “hitokatsu”. If both teams win on each of the first two games, a third game is played (“san no kiri”), and the winner of the third game is the winner of the “honkatsu”.
