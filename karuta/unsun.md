Unsun Karuta [うんすんカルタ], was a Japanese playing card deck that expanded the Portuguese-designed decks such as [Tensho Karuta](/en/tensho) to accomodate more players.

A further expansion was also made, called [Sunkun Karuta](/en/karuta/sunkun).

# The deck
The deck contains 5 suits, with 15 cards per suit, for a total of **75 cards**.

Suits are categorized into 2 groups: **Long Suits and Round Suits**. 
- The Long suits are: Clubs and Swords.
- The Round suits are: Cups, Coins, and Drums.

>The groups correspond to Black Suits and Red Suits of Western Playing Cards respectively.
