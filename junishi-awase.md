**Jūnishi Awase** [十二支合わせ - じゅうにしあわせ, lit. 'zodiac matching'] is an adaptation of [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) using children's cards of the same name, consisting of four cards for each of the 12 Chinese Zodiac animals. 

Existing versions of this deck today are of either the [menko](/en/menko) or combination western playing card format, made in the mid-20th century. Points are written on the cards themselves, which vary depending on the manufacturer.

# Gameplay
Use only 48 cards (4 cards for each of the 12 zodiac animals) from the deck.
The gameplay is entirely identical to [Makatsu Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana#makatsu-bakappana-%E7%9B%AE%E5%8B%9D%E9%A6%AC%E9%B9%BF%E8%8A%B1): Players play until they run out of cards in hand, and the player with the most points wins the round and receives 1 share each from the other players.
