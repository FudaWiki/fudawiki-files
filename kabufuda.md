Kabufuda are the most common design of single-suited Japanese playing cards. This deck consists of 4 identical sets of cards valued from 1 to 10, with the exception of one Ace whose design differs entirely from the other three, and one “4” which features silver and/or gold overprinting. It ultimately derives from the suit of clubs used in Portuguese playing cards.
