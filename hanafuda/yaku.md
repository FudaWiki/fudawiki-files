In Japanese games, a **Yaku** (役, literally *'role/position'*) refers to a specific situation, which, when it occurs, typically gives certain players points.

In most hanafuda games, the term "**yaku**" refers to a **set of cards** which, when obtained by a player, typically gives that player points for that set.

Typically there are two kinds of Yaku: **Teyaku** and **Dekiyaku**. Other Yaku that either do not meet the definition of the two, or are treated specially, are called **Special Yaku**.




# Teyaku
**Teyaku** are sets of cards that are **formed in a player's hand**. Players typically check for them after the dealer has dealt the cards.

In some fishing games like Koi-koi, Teyaku are refered to as **"Lucky Hands"**, due to them immediately stopping the round and awarding the player points. However, in fishing games where Teyaku do not stop the round after being obtained, they are typically bad hands to play.

In showdown games, however, Teyaku are special hands that are usually considered **stronger than the highest value** of a typical hand.

# Dekiyaku
In fishing games, **Dekiyaku** are sets of cards that are **formed within a player's captured cards**. Players consciously capture cards from the field in order to form these sets, while preventing their opponent(s) from doing the same.

In fishing games with few to no Teyaku, the term **'Yaku'** is used to refer to Dekiyaku specifically.


# Special Yaku
In some games, there are also **Special Yaku** (特殊役, tokushuyaku), which may be sets or conditions that do not exactly match the definition of either Teyaku or Dekiyaku. 

They may also refer to Teyaku or Dekiyaku which are treated differently from other normal Teyaku or Dekiyaku. For instance, in Hachi-hachi, Special Yaku are Dekiyaku that are checked separately from normal Dekiyaku, and do not stop the round unlike normal Dekiyaku.


# Lists of Yaku Names

The following Hanafuda Yaku will be categorized according to their type and composition and arranged in the alphabetical order. 

For a list of all Hanafuda Yaku Names, see [Glossary of Hanafuda Yaku Names](/en/hanafuda/yaku/glossary).

> Note that Yaku outside of games that can be played using Hanafuda cards are **not included** in these lists.
