_Hanafuda Yaku-Narabe_ (<span lang='ja'>花札役並べ</span>, "Hanafuda Yaku Line-Up") is a hanafuda solitaire video game for iOS and Android. It is developed by Kiloline and published in 2025.

The solitaire game is the developer's original creation. While made for a video game, it can also be played with physical hanafuda cards.

# Rules
## General
The deck is shuffled, and the player takes the top two cards as hand cards. The playing area consists of 5 slots that can each hold a column of (max 9) cards.

Each turn, the player plays one card from their hand to a column of their choice. Cards are played below any other cards that are already in that column. Then the player draws a new card from the deck, replenishing their hand to two cards.

At the end of a turn, if there is at least one card in each column, any yaku contained in the 5 cards in the top row are scored, and the top row of cards is removed. The cards right below them become the new top row.

> When playing with real cards, it is easier to not remove completed rows, and score all rows at the end of the round. However, this would remove the memory skill element of the game.
{.is-info}

The round ends when all cards have been played to the playing area. Yaku in unfinished rows are not scored. All cards are resuffled and the next round begins. A game lasts 3, 6 or 12 rounds.

## Monthly bonus
Cards of the month corresponding to the current round each give a score multiplier to the row they are in. Multiple montly bonus cards in the same row increase the multiplier. (For example, in the first round this would apply to all January/pine cards, and in the second round to all February/plum blossom cards. The in-game interface displays the current month in the top left corner.)

Multipliers:

* 1 bonus card - yaku score ×2
* 2 bonus cards - yaku score ×3
* 3 bonus cards - yaku score ×4
* 4 bonus cards - yaku score ×5

> All yaku in the same row as the monthly bonus card(s) get the multiplier, regardless of whether the bonus card contributes to the yaku or not.
{.is-info}

## Goal

The goal is to get a score as high as possible, and improve your own high scores.

There are also [achievements](#achievements) to aim for, which consist mostly of completing specific yaku a certain number of times over all games, or achieving an impressive score a certain number of times.

Based on those achievements, getting a score of 300 points in a single round is considered impressive, as is getting an average of 200 points per round over an entire game (600 points total for 3 rounds, 1200 points total for 6 rounds, 2400 points total for 12 rounds).

# Yaku
The Bright-only yaku are mutually exclusive, but other than that, all yaku **stack**: the player scores for all the yaku in a completed row of cards.

Most yaku are borrowed from [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) and [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase).

# Interface navigation guide
A guide for navigating the Japanese interface.

> A lot of menus in the game have タイトル画面にもどる (return to main menu) or 設定画面にもどる (return to options menu) written at the bottom. Confusingly, they do not look like navigation buttons, but they are.
{.is-warning}
## Main menu
The main menu looks as follows:

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| || <big>⚙️</big><br>[options](#options-menu)|
| <br><span style="color: grey;">*(game title)*</span><br> |||
|◀　3/6/12ヵ月　▶<br>3/6/12 months (game length)|||
|初めから開始<br>[New game](#starting-a-new-game)|||
|続きから開始<br>Continue game|||
|遊び方<br>How to play|役一覧<br>Yaku overview|実績<br>[Achievements](#achievements)|

If there is an on-going game saved, there is some text below the "Continue game" button showing the current game length setting, and whether an ad was watched for double achievement points (実績2倍**有り**) or not (実績2倍**無し**).

## Starting a new game
A new game is started by tapping on 初めから開始 ("start from the beginning") in the main menu.

If there is still an unfinished game saved, the game will first ask whether you are sure you want to start a new game and lose progress.
* いいえ = no (retain save file, and return to main menu)
* はい = yes (delete save file, and start new game)

If there is no such saved game or if choosing to delete it, the game will ask whether you want to watch an ad to get twice the progression on achievements.

* みない = don't watch an ad
* みる = watch an ad

Selecting みない ("don't watch") will start the game right away. Selecting みる ("watch") will show an ad, followed by a screen reporting whether the ad rewards were successfully awarded or not. A short two-line message means it was successful, and the double achievements mode is turned on. A longer multi-paragraph message means the ad was cut short, and regular mode is active. (Go to the main menu and start a new game if you want to try watching an ad again.)

Tap the ゲーム開始 ("start game") button to confirm and start the game.

## Gameplay interface
The top of the game interface shows your current round score, your total score so far, and your current high score (from before starting the current game). It looks something like this:

|:--:|
|<big>18文</big><br><span style="color: grey;">*18 points*</span><br><br>合計　316文<br><span style="color: grey;">*Total　316 points*</span><br>(過去最高記録　2664文)<br><span style="color: grey;">*High score　2664 points*</span>|

The bottom right corner shows how many cards are left in the draw pile. In the upper left corner is an image of the monthly bonus suit of the current round (with the name of the corresponding month from the traditional [Japanese lunar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calendar#Months)).

## Options menu
The options menu looks as follows:
