_Hanafuda Gēmu Dai Shūgō_ (<span lang='ja'>花札ゲーム大集合</span>, lit. "Great Collection of Hanafuda Video Games") is an Android/iOS game published in 2011. It was developed by Moco-Game.

The same developer also made an offshoot game called [*_Mobairu Oicho-Kabu_*](/en/kabufuda/video-games/android-ios/mobairu-oicho-kabu), which is for playing games with [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda) cards.

## Available games
The following hanafuda games can be played in this app:

* [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi)
* [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase)
* [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana)
* [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) (6 or [2 players](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#hachi-hachi-for-two-players))

[Oicho-Kabu](/en/hanafuda/games/oicho-kabu) is also included in the in-game list of available games, but instead of starting a new game, it links to a download page for [their kabufuda app](/en/kabufuda/video-games/android-ios/mobairu-oicho-kabu).
