## Rules
- Koi-Koi

## Game types:
- **5 round game**
  The player with the highest total score after 5 rounds wins. Let's try to get a high score!

- **200 sentence game**
  The first player to reach the 200-point mark wins. The higher the score, the higher the minimum sentence value required to win. 
  - 0-29 sentences = 1 sentence or more required
  - 30-59 sentences = 2 sentences or more
  - 60-89 sentences = 3 sentences or more
  - 90-119 sentences = 4 sentences or more
  - 120-149 sentences = 5 sentences or more
  - 150-200 sentences = 10 sentences or more
  
  It's going to get harder and harder, but keep at it!

- **Tug-of-war game**
  This is a game in which you hold 30 sentences each at the beginning, and when the game is over, you take sentences from the loser. Goal is to reduce the opponent to 0 sentences. However, if the game is not won within 10 rounds, it is a draw. Try to beat your opponent as quickly as possible.

- **Role-limited game**
  The winner is the first player to five rounds, with the only restriction being that the player must collect the specified yaku. Try to get a high score by playing high yaku.

## Options
- Tsukimi-zake & Hanami-zake
- Ame-nagare (ame cards cancel above yakus)
- Sake cup as junk card

## Gameplay
- The initial match card can be chosen from either your hand or the field, and following matches from the opposite. This is unique as most (all?) other games have you pick the first match only from your hand.

## Compatibility
- Only works on certain Palm devices (monochrome screen?)
- Playable on Sony Clié PEG-SL10 running PalmOS 4.1
- Playable on Android using StyleTap (without Japanese text support)
- Use CJKOS or J-OS (PalmOS apps) to have the Japanese text in the user interface display correctly
