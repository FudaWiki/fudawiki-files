## Rules
- Koi-Koi

## Game types:
- **5 round game**
  Highest score after five rounds wins.

- **200 sentence game**
  The first player to reach the 200-point mark wins. The higher the score, the higher the minimum sentence value. 
  - 0-29 sentences = 1 sentence or more required
  - 30-59 sentences = 2 sentences or more
  - 60-89 sentences = 3 sentences or more
  - 90-119 sentences = 4 sentences or more
  - 120-149 sentences = 5 sentences or more
  - 150-200 sentences = 10 sentences or more
  
  It's going to get harder and harder, but keep at it!

- **First-draw game**
  This is a game in which you hold 30 sentences each at the beginning, and when the game is over, you take a sentence from the loser. Goal is to reduce the opponent to 0 sentences. However, if the game is not won within 10 rounds, it is a draw. Try to beat your opponent as quickly as possible.

- **Role-limited game**
  The winner is the first player to five rounds, with the only restriction being that the player must collect the specified yaku. Try to get a high score by playing high yaku.

## Options
- Tsukimi-zake & Hanami-zake
- Ame-nagare (ame cards cancel above yakus)
- Sake cup as junk card

## Gameplay
- allows chosing initial match card from either your hand or the field and following matches from the opposite, which is unique as most (all?) other games have you pick the first match only from the field

## Compatibility
- only works on certain Palm devices (monochrome screen?)
- playable on Sony Clié PEG-SL10 running PalmOS 4.1
- playable on Android using StyleTap
- use CJKOS for Palm to have Japanese text in user interface display correctly
