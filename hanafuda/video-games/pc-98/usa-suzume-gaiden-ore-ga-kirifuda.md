3. download PC-98 System files <https://github.com/Abdess/retroarch_system/tree/libretro/NEC%20-%20PC-98>
4. start RetroArch
5. system files will need to go into RetroArch System folder, check Settings > Directory > System/BIOS and move them there
6. Download PC-98 core: main menu > online updater > core downloader > NEC PC-98 (Neko project II Kai)
