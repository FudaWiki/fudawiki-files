_Isseki Hacchou: Kore 1-pon de 8 Shurui!_ (<span lang='ja'>一石八鳥 これ1本で8種類！</span>, "Eight birds with one stone: 8 types with this one title!") is a GBA game published in 2002 by Konami. It was developed by Konami Studio. The game features [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) and [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), alongside 2 mahjong games and 4 games with Western playing cards.

# Gameplay and rules
The game has both single-player and multiplayer modes. CPU opponents have 3 difficulty levels, and hanafuda games have game length options for 4, 8 or 12 rounds.

## Koi-Koi rules
Notes about the specific [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) rules used in this game.

General notes:

* The Sake Cup counts only as an Animal card, never as a Chaff card.
* There aren't any score multiplier rules
* By default, there is a Dealer's Priviledge rule (*oyaken*), where the dealer wins 3 points in case of a tie. There is an option to turn it off.
* There are game options for turning off Viewing yaku and Rainy 4 Brights.
* The game uses cumulative scoring (not zero-sum)

Yaku values:

* Boar-Deer-Butterflies (*Ino-Shika-Chō*) is set at a fixed 5 points, and Poetry/Blue Ribbons (*Akatan/Aotan*) at 6 points. (Both can combine with regular Animals/Ribbons yaku.)
* High values for Bright yaku are used (6, 8, 10, 15 points for 3 Brights, Rainy 4 Brights, 4 Brights and 5 Brights respectively).
* Flower Viewing (*hanami-zake*) and Moon Viewing (*tsukimi-zake*) each score 3 points.

## Hana-Awase rules
Notes about the specific [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) rules used in this game.

General notes:

* Chaff cards are worth 0 points, which means the par score is 80 rather than 88.
* There is a *Fuke* rule option (turned off by default). Instead of negating all scoring, it gives a yaku score of 80 to players whose captured cards add up to 25 points or lower.

Yaku notes:
* There are yaku for Animals, Ribbons and Chaff, similar to Koi-Koi. 5 Animals, 6 Ribbons and 12 Chaff are each worth 20 points, with 20 extra points to each additional card of the same rank.
(Note: this Ribbons yaku replaces the typical 6 Ribbons and 7 Ribbons yaku.)
* Yaku inventory:
  * Always included: 5 Brights, 4 Brights, Poetry Ribbons (*akatan*), Blue Ribbons (*aotan*), Boar-Deer-Butterflies (*ino-shika-chō*), Ribbons, Chaff
  * Included by default (can be turned off): Rainy 4 Brights, Flower Viewing (*hanami-zake*), Moon Viewing (*tsukimi-zake*), Animals
  * Optional (turned off by default): Front Sugawara (*omote Sugawara*), Four-of-a-Kind yaku ("*shima*", for Wisteria, Willow and Paulownia), *Fuke*
  * Notably not included: Pine-Paulownia-Baldy (*matsu-kiri-bōzu*), Grass Ribbons (*kusatan*)
* Almost all yaku are worth 20 points. The exceptions are 5 Brights at 100 points, 4 Brights at 40 points, *Fuke* at 80 points, and the Animals/Ribbons/Chaff yaku explained above.
