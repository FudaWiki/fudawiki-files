_Clubhouse Games_, published as _42 All Time Classics_ in Europe and _Daredemo Asobi Taizen_ (<span lang='ja'>だれでもアソビ大全</span>) in Japan, is a game collection for the Nintendo DS that includes [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi). It was published in 2005 by Nintendo, and was developed by Agenda. The Japanese title translates to "a complete collection of games that anyone can play."

Clubhouse Games got a [sequel for the Nintendo Switch](/en/hanafuda/video-games/switch/51-worldwide-games) in 2020.

# Gameplay and rules
## Gameplay
The game has both single player and multiplayer modes. The CPU opponent has three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard). In the main menu, the Koi-Koi game is called "hanafuda" (はなふだ) in the Japanese version, but "Koi-Koi" in English.

When determining the dealer, players can choose out of 12 different cards, namely the highest-ranked card from each month randomly shuffled.

Somewhat curiously, captured cards are only sorted by Chaff and non-Chaff, with Bright, Animal and Ribbon cards mixed together. They are ordered by when they are captured, with new captures being added on the righthand side of each row of cards.

By default, cards in the hand that match cards in the field are highlighted with a pulsing animation. This can be turned off with the "Hints" setting. When the "Auto Sort" setting is on, cards in the hand are automatically ordered by suit (while cards on the field are not). When turned off, cards can be manually sorted with L and R buttons.

The card backs alternate between black in odd rounds and red in even rounds. Different backgrounds can be unlocked (one for each of the four seasons) by winning a certain amount of games.

## Koi-Koi rules
Most notably, each player can only declare koi-koi once in each round.

Other than that, the game closely follows rules from Nintendo's Japanese Koi-Koi pamphlet. This means:
* The winner's score is doubled if their yaku are worth 7 or more points, or if their opponent has called "koi-koi" in the same round. (These stack, so if both are true, the score is quadrupled.)
* The yaku Boar-Deer-Butterflies (*Ino-Shika-Chō*), Blue Ribbons, and Poetry Ribbons are each worth 5 points plus 1 for each additional Animal/Ribbon card.
* Blue and Poetry Ribbons combine into a separate yaku, worth 10 points plus 1 for each additional Ribbon card.
* The Bright yaku are worth 5, 7, 8 and 10 points for 3 Brights, Rainy 4 Brights, 4 Brights, and 5 Brights respectively.
* Lucky Hands (*teyaku*) are included, earning 6 points each.

Additionally, in this game only Bright yaku are exclusive with eachother. This means that Blue Ribbons and Poetry Ribbons are _not_ exclusive with the regular Ribbons yaku, and likewise, Boar-Deer-Butterflies is _not_ exclusive with the regular Animals yaku.

> Example: If you have 3 Blue Ribbons and 3 assorted Ribbon cards, you score 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;3 points for Blue Ribbons *and* 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 points for Ribbons, for a total of 10 points.
> 
> This is more than in some other rulesets, where these cards would be worth 7 or 8 points total. (Either Blue Ribbons invalidates Ribbons scoring only 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;3 for Blue Ribbons, or you get a fixed 5 or 6 points for Blue Ribbons plus 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 for Ribbons.)

> Note: I have not yet managed to test how Blue Ribbons and Poetry Ribbons interact when you get both at the same time in this game.

Players start with 50 points each, and the game continues normally when a player's score goes in the negative.

In the game settings it's possible to individually turn off the yaku for Flower Viewing ("Cherry Blossom Bonus") and Moon Viewing ("Full Moon Bonus"), and set the amount of rounds (3, 6, 9 or 12).
