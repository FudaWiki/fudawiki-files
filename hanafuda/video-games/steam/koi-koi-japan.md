# Gameplay and Rules

## Notes on Koi-Koi rules
Most notable rules:
* The Moon Viewing (*Tsukimizake*) and Flower Viewing (*Hanamizake*) yaku are worth only 1 point each. If you call Koi-Koi, their value is upgraded to 3 points each.
* Calling Koi-Koi earns you additional points and multipliers, similar to in [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop). Calling Koi-Koi 1-3 times gives 1-3 bonus points respectively, and calling Koi-Koi 4-7 times will instead give a score multiplier of 2-5 times (increasing by one each time).
* When the game ends in a draw, the non-dealer (*Ko*) pays 1 point to the dealer (*Oya*).
* There are no score multipliers for having 7 or more points, or for winning after the opponent called Koi-Koi.

Additional details:
* Blue Ribbons (*Aotan*), Poetry Ribbons (*Akatan*), and Boar-Deer-Butterflies (*InoShikaCho*) are each worth a fixed 5 points, and can be combined with regular Animals and Ribbons yaku.
* Red&Poetry Ribbons combines with the three other Ribbons yaku, effectively giving a 10 point bonus for having both Blue Ribbons and Poetry Ribbons.

## Notes on Hana-Awase rules
The rules and yaku are very standard, with only minor differences from the [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) article on Fuda Wiki.
* Five Brights (*Gokou*) is worth 200 points instead of 100
* Drinking (*Nomi*) is worth 30 instead of 40
* The three Four-of-a-Kind yaku are worth 20 instead of 10
* Spring *(OmoteSugawara*) can be combined with Bright yaku
