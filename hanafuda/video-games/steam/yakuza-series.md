The _Like a Dragon_ (<span lang='ja'>龍が如く, Ryū ga Gotoku</span>) series, previously marketed outside of Asia as the _Yakuza_ series, is a series of video games created by Toshihiro Nagoshi for Sega. Its first game was released in 2005, and the series is still ongoing, featuring over two dozen games. It is a multiplatform series, with most games being released for PlayStation, Windows, Xbox, and occasionally Nintendo systems.

From 2008 on, almost all video games in the series featured [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) and [Oicho-Kabu](/en/hanafuda/games/oicho-kabu) as minigames that players can play against non-player characters to gamble in-game money.

# Gameplay and Rules
## Koi-Koi
Notes about the particular [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) rules used in most video games in the series:
* The sake cup can only count as an animal ("variety") card or a chaff ("junk") card, not both at the same time. The player gets to choose which they want when they make a yaku involving the sake cup. Turning off "Junk Modifier" in the game settings makes the sake cup always count as an animal card.
* There is a Cards of the Month or "Season" yaku (capturing all 4 cards belonging to the month of the current round), which is worth 4 points. There is a setting to turn it off, but it is on by default.
* Boar-Deer-Butterflies, Poetry Ribbons and Blue Ribbons are each worth a fixed 5 points, and are not exclusive with regular Animals and Ribbons yaku.
* The values of Bright yaku are 10, 8, 7, and 6 points (for 5, 4, Rainy 4, and 3 Brights respectively)
* There are also game settings for turning off double score for 7+ points or Viewing yaku, and for setting the game length (3, 6, 9 or 12 rounds).

## Oicho-Kabu
A lot of details of the [Oicho-Kabu](/en/hanafuda/games/oicho-kabu) rules are notably different from those described on its Fuda Wiki articles.

General rule notes:
* The game is always played with 4 players, including the dealer. The dealer role rotates each round.
* There are no dead cards given to players.
* The dealer's first card is revealed before players place their bets.
* Players can only place bets on one card, and two players can't place bets on the same card.
* There is no shared maximum bet.
* In the game phase where non-dealer players decide whether to take a third card, the turn order is based on which cards players placed bets on, from left to right. It is not based on seating order.
* When it's the turn of the card without any bets on it, two face-up cards are dealt on it.
* The dealer wins in case of a tie.

Yaku rule notes:
* Four-One (*Shippin*) is exclusive to non-dealer players, and Nine-One (*Kuppin*) is exclusive to the dealer. They don't have to be in a specific order (i.e. 1-4 is the same as 4-1). Nine-One wins from Four-One, and both lose from Three of a Kind (*Arashi*)
* If you win with Four-One or Nine-One, your opponent pays you double the usual amount. If you win with Three of a Kind, your opponent pays triple.
* Optional yaku: 10-10-1 (in any order) is even better than 3-of-a-kind, and gives 20 times the pay. (Japanese name: *Doshippin*)
* Optional yaku: If a non-dealer player gets 4 and 6 (in any order), they can choose to drop out of the current round and get their wager back. (Japanese name: *Shiroku*)

Oicho-Kabu can be played either with kabufuda or hanafuda, depending on the game settings.

## Oicho-Kabu

Oicho-Kabu terminology is as much as possible replaced with regular numbers rather than traditional Japanese (number) terms. E.g. Japanese versions of the games use the [special number names](/en/hanafuda/games/oicho-kabu#terminology-and-trivia) ("Buta" through "Kabu"), but they are translated as "Zero" through "Nine" in English.
