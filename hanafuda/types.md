**Card ranks** are a way of grouping specific cards across different [suits](/en/hanafuda/suits) in the [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) deck. If the 12 suits in a hanafuda deck are analogous to the 13 values in a Western deck, the 4 hanafuda card ranks can be said to be analogous to the Western deck's 4 suits. However, **each card rank contains a different number of cards and is distributed differently across the suits.** 

In almost all [fishing games](/en/hanafuda/games), cards of a given rank are more likely to form yaku with one another.
# Standard ranks
There are generally considered to be 4 distinct card ranks for the purpose of most hanafuda games. The way to which these are referred varies widely, but their groupings tend to be the same, with occasional exceptions. They are often referred to by their values in the game of [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), especially in Japanese.


### Brights[^10]
These cards are usually the most important cards in games, with the highest value. For instance, in Hachi-Hachi, they are each worth **20** points.

# Other categorizations
While the above is considered the standard grouping of card ranks and is applicable to many of the most popular games like [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) and [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), some games group the cards in a different manner.
- In [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana), there is a 5-tiered distinction of cards worth 30, 20, 10, 5, or 0 points, which splits the Brights and Animals differently.
- In [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken), the [![Icon for month 2](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x)Bush Warbler](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler) is treated as a Bright rather than an Animal, and the [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia Chaff](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff) is worth the same as an Animal or Ribbon.
- In [Sakura](/en/hanafuda/games/sakura), the values of Animal and Ribbon cards are reversed; in addition, the [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) counts as an Animal rather than a Bright, and the [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia Chaff](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff) is treated as a Ribbon.
