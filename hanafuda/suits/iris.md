![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =25x)Iris [菖蒲 - あやめ, *ayame*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the fifth suit, representing the month of May [五月	- ごがつ, *gogatsu*] or the numeral 5. The cards in this suit all feature bluish iris blossoms. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Iris suit features an Eight-Plank-Bridge [八橋 - やつはし, *yatsuhashi*] over a blue marsh.
# Eight-Plank Bridge
![50.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/50.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) The Bridge card does not feature prominently in the most popular hanafuda games, but does contribute to the generic Animal yaku in [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop) and [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi).

This card's design is a reference to Section IX of the Tales of Ise, a compilation of prose and poetry from the 10-11th century, in which a man and his companions travel to the land of Eight Bridges in Mikawa province, a swampy land with a zigzag of bridges built over its branching rivers.
# Plain Ribbon
![51.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/51.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)The Iris Ribbon combines with the [Wisteria Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria#plain-ribbon) and [Bush Clover Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#plain-ribbon) in [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop) to form the "Grass Ribbons" yaku. In many other games it plays no special role other than contributing to generic Ribbon yaku.
# Chaff
![52.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/52.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)![53.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/53.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) The Iris suit, like most, contains two Chaff cards. In some designs, notably the [echigobana] pattern, these cards will each contain half of the following acrostic poem, possibly composed by Arihara no Narihira, from Section IX of the Tales of Ise. The first syllable of each line, when added together, spell "kakituhata," an older pronunciation of "kakitsubata," which is another name in Japanese for the iris.
