Iris [菖蒲 - あやめ, *ayame*] is the name of a suit in traditional hanafuda decks. It is generally taken to be the fifth suit, representing the month of May [五月	- ごがつ, *gogatsu*] or the numeral 5. The cards in this suit all feature bluish iris blossoms. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Iris suit features an Eight-Plank-Bridge [八橋 - やつはし, *yatsuhashi*] over a blue marsh.
