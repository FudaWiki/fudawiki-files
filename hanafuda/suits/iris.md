![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =25x)Iris [菖蒲 - あやめ, *ayame*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the fifth suit, representing the month of May [五月	- ごがつ, *gogatsu*] or the numeral 5. The cards in this suit all feature bluish iris blossoms. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Iris suit features an Eight-Plank-Bridge [八橋 - やつはし, *yatsuhashi*] over a blue marsh.

In some designs, notably the [echigobana] pattern, these cards will each contain half of the following acrostic poem from Section IX of the Tales of Ise. The first syllable of each line, when added together, spell "kakituhata," an older pronunciation of "kakitsubata," which is another name in Japanese for the iris.
