![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =25x)**Iris** [菖蒲, *ayame*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the fifth suit, representing the month of May [5月, *gogatsu*] or the number 5. In Korean, the suit is commonly called Orchid [난초, *nancho*] instead.

The cards in this suit all feature bluish iris blossoms. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Iris suit features an Eight-Plank Bridge [八橋, *yatsuhashi*] over a blue marsh.

# Name
The suit is usually called *ayame* [菖蒲] in Japanese, which refers to the the species *Iris sanguinea*, but the flower depicted on the card is actually a different species called rabbit-ear iris, or *kakitsubata* [杜若] in Japanese. The two species look similar, but *ayame* does not grow in moist soil along water and is not referenced in the Tales of Ise, unlike *kakitsubata*. Because of this, some people (including hanafuda manufacturer [Ōishi Tengudō](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/oishitengudo)) claim that *kakitsubata* is the correct name of the suit, but a large majority of sources still call it *ayame* regardless.

# Cards
## Eight-Plank Bridge
![50.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/50.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Iris with Eight-Plank Bridge** [菖蒲に八橋, *ayame ni yatsuhashi*], or simply **Bridge**, is the animal card of the Wisteria suit.

The Bridge card does not feature prominently in the most popular Japanese hanafuda games, but in the Korean game of [Min-Hwatu](/en/hanafuda/games/minhwatu) it forms a yaku together with the three other iris cards, and in the Hawaiian game of [Sakura](/en/hanafuda/games/sakura) it features in the Animal counterpart of the Grass Ribbons yaku with [Wisteria's Cuckoo card](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria#cuckoo-with-crescent-moon) and [Bush Clover's Boar card](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#boar).

## Plain Ribbon
![51.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/51.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Iris with Ribbon** [菖蒲に短冊, *ayame ni tanzaku*] is the Ribbon card of the Iris suit.

This card combines with the [Wisteria Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria#plain-ribbon) and [Bush Clover Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#plain-ribbon) to form the "Grass Ribbons" yaku in many games, including [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken), and [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/video-games/ds/go-stop-ds). In other games such as [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) and [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) it merely contributes to generic Ribbon yaku.

## Chaff
![52.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/52.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)![53.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/53.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) The Iris suit, like most, contains two Chaff cards.

In some designs, notably the [echigobana] pattern, these cards will each contain half of the following acrostic poem, possibly composed by Arihara no Narihira, from Section IX of the Tales of Ise. The first syllable of each line, when added together, spell "*kakituhata*," an older pronunciation of "*kakitsubata*."

# Cultural significance

The Bridge card is a reference to Section IX of the Tales of Ise, a compilation of prose and poetry from the 10-11th century. In it a man and his companions travel to the land of [Eight Bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Bridges) in Mikawa province, a swampy land with a zigzag of bridges built over its eight branching rivers where a lot of irises bloomed. As the man rested here, he composed the poem in the section above. The zigzag bridge became a well-known literary motif in Japan, often depicted with irises.

Eight-plank bridges are a style of bridge that can be found in Japanese gardens. They have eight sections in a zig-zag arrangement that cross over a marshy section of the garden where irises are typically planted, in reference to the Tales of Ise.

*Kakitsubata* irises bloom in May and June.
