![Icon for month 9](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =25x)**Chrysanthemum** [菊, *kiku*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the ninth suit, representing the month of September [9月, *kugatsu*] or the number 9.

The cards in this suit all feature variegated yellow and red or orange chrysanthemum flowers. There are two Chaff cards, one Blue Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Chrysanthemum suit features a red Sake Cup [盃, *sakazuki*] inscribed with a character meaning "longevity" [寿, *kotobuki*].

# Cards
## Sake Cup
![90.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/90.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Chrysanthemum with Sake Cup** [菊に盃, *kiku ni sakazuki*], or simply **Sake Cup** or **Cup**, is the Animal card of the Chrysanthemum suit.

In the game of [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), many popular variants include a rule where the Sake Cup counts as an Animal card and a Chaff card at the same time. Similarly, in the closely-related Korean game of [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop), players must typically choose whether to count the card as an Animal card or as two Chaff cards.

## Blue Ribbon
![91.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/91.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Chrysanthemum with Blue Ribbon** [菊に青短, *kiku ni aotan*] is the Ribbon card of the Chrysanthemum suit, and one of the three Blue Ribbons.

The Chrysanthemum Ribbon combines with the [Peony Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony#blue-ribbon) and [Maple Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple#blue-ribbon) in a large number of games to form the yaku called "Blue Ribbons."

## Chaff
