![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =25x)Susuki Grass [芒 - すすき, *susuki*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the eighth suit, representing the month of August [八月	- はちがつ, *hachigatsu*] or the numeral 8. The cards in this suit all feature hilly fields of susuki grass. There are two Chaff cards, one Animal, and one Bright. The Animal card of the Susuki Grass suit features a flock of (usually three) geese [雁 - かり, *kari*] flying above the hill. The Bright card features a large, white full moon [月 - つき, *tsuki*] in front of a red sky.
