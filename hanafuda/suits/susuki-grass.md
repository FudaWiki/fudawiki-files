![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =25x)**Susuki Grass** [芒 or 薄, *susuki*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the eighth suit, representing the month of August [8月, *hachigatsu*] or the number 8. In Korean, this suit is commonly known as ‘Empty Mountain’ [공산, 空山, *gongsan*] instead.

The cards in this suit all feature a hill with stylized reeds of susuki grass in the foreground, sometimes reinterpreted as a hilly landscape or a mountain top. There are two Chaff cards, one Animal, and one Bright. The Animal card of the Susuki Grass suit features a flock of (usually three) geese [雁, *kari*] flying above the hill. The Bright card features a large, white full moon [月, *tsuki*] in front of a red sky.

![80.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/80.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Susuki Grass with Moon** [芒に月, *susuki ni tsuki*], or **(Full) Moon** for short, is the Bright card of the Susuki Grass suit.

Alternative Japanese names include ‘Susuki Grass with Full Moon’ [芒に満月, *susuki ni mangetsu*, or 芒に望月, *susuki ni mochizuki*], ‘Mountain with Moon’ [山に月, *yama ni tsuki*], and ‘Shaven Head’ [坊主, *bōzu*].[^1]

[^1]: *Bōzu* [坊主] literally means Buddhist monk, but it's also short for *bōzu-atama* [坊主頭, lit. ‘monk head’], a word for a short buzz cut or a bald head (more commonly shaven rather than naturally bald), in reference to how Buddhist monks shave their heads. The name is used in hanafuda because the black hill on Susuki Grass cards resembles the top of someone's head with black stubble or short black hairs.
