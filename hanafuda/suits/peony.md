**Peony** [牡丹 - ぼたん, *botan*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the sixth suit, representing the month of **June** [六月	- ろくがつ,	*rokugatsu*] or the numeral 6. 

The cards in this suit all feature **red [peony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peony) flowers**. There are two Chaff cards, one Blue Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Peony suit features **butterflies** [蝶 - ちょう, *chō*] fluttering above the fragrant peonies.

*In a few games, including Tensho, an alternate month ordering is used, with the Peony suit representing November or the number 11 instead.*
