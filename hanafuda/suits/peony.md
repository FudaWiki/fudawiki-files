![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =25x)**Peony** [牡丹, *botan*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the sixth suit, representing the month of **June** [6月,	*rokugatsu*] or the number 6. 

The cards in this suit all feature **red [peony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peony) flowers**. There are two Chaff cards, one Blue Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Peony suit features **butterflies** [蝶, *chō*] fluttering above the fragrant peonies.

*In a few games, including Tensho, an alternate month ordering is used, with the Peony suit representing November or the number 11 instead.*

# Cards
## Butterflies
![60.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/60.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)  **Peony with Butterflies** [牡丹に蝶, *botan ni chō*], or simply **Butterflies**, is the Animal card of the Peony suit.

This card is part of the famous "Boar-Dear-Butterflies" [猪鹿蝶, inoshikachō] yaku in many hanafuda games from Japan<!--as opposed to Korean and Hawaiian games-->, including [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) and [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken).

## Blue Ribbon
![61.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/61.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Peony with Blue Ribbon** [牡丹に青短, *botan ni aotan*] is the Ribbon card of the Peony suit, and one of the three Blue Ribbons.

The Peony Ribbon combines with the [Chrysanthemum Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#blue-ribbon) and [Maple Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple#blue-ribbon) in a large number of games to form the yaku called "Blue Ribbons."

## Chaff
