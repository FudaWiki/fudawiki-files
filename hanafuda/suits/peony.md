Peony [牡丹 - ぼたん, *botan*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the sixth suit, representing the month of June [六月	- ろくがつ,	*rokugatsu*] or the numeral 6. The cards in this suit all feature red peony flowers. There are two Chaff cards, one Blue Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Peony suit features butterflies [蝶 - ちょう, *chō*] fluttering above the fragrant peonies.

In a few games, including Tensho, an alternate month ordering is used, with the Peony suit representing November or the number 11 instead.
