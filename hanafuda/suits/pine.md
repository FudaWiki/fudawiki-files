Pine [松 - まつ, *matsu*] is the name of a suit in traditional hanafuda decks. It is generally taken to be the first suit, representing the month of January [一月 - いちがつ, *ichigatsu*] or the numeral 1. The cards in this suit all feature pine trees. There are two Chaff cards, one Poetry Ribbon, and one Bright. The Bright card of the Pine suit features a crane [鶴 - つる *tsuru*] among the pines as well as a red sun in the top corner of the card.
