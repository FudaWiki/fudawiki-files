![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =25x)**Paulownia** [桐, *kiri*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the twelfth and final suit, representing the month of December [12月, *jūnigatsu*] or the number 12.

The cards in this suit all feature large paulownia leaves with purple flowers and capsules. There are three Chaff cards and one Bright. The Bright card features a purple and red Phoenix [鳳凰, *hōō*] above the paulownia plant, with the area below the plant generally colored yellow.

In a few games, including Tensho, an alternate month ordering is used, with the Paulownia suit representing June or the number 6 instead. On the other hand, in the [Korean](/en/hanafuda/hwatu) suit order, Paulownia is considered to represent November or the number 11.

# Cards
## Phoenix
![120.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/120.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Paulownia with Phoenix** [桐に鳳凰, *kiri ni hōō*], or simply **Phoenix**, is the Bright card of the Paulownia suit.

## Chaff
The Paulownia suit uniquely has three Chaff cards. One of the three Chaff cards generally has a colored area below the paulownia. Some combination of these three cards usually feature the name of the deck's manufacturer, that company's logo, and/or other information about the deck.

### Yellow-bottom Chaff
![121.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/121.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) One of the Paulownia Chaff cards is usually marked with a different-colored background on the bottom of the card, typically yellow in Japan and red in Korea. In Japan it is also known as **yellow Chaff** [黄カス, *ki-kasu*] or **(Paulownia's) different-colored Chaff card** [(桐の)色違いのカス札, *(kiri no) iro-chigai no kasu-fuda*].

In most games it is not distinguished from the other two chaff cards, but some games do make a distinction. For example, in the game of [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/ds/go-stop) it has the same value as two chaff cards, and in the games of [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken) and [Sakura](/en/hanafuda/games/sakura) it has the same value as a Ribbon card.
### Other Chaff
