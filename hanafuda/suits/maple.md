![Icon for month 10](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_10.png =25x)**Maple** [紅葉, *momiji*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the tenth suit, representing the month of October [10月, *jūgatsu*] or the number 10.

The cards in this suit all feature falling maple leaves of different colors. There are two Chaff cards, one Blue Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Maple suit features an orange Deer [鹿, *shika*] standing alongside a maple tree.

# Cards
## Deer
![100.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/100.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Maple with Deer** [紅葉に鹿, *momiji ni shika*], or simply **Deer**, is the Animal card of the Maple suit.

This card is part of the famous "Boar-Dear-Butterflies" [猪鹿蝶, inoshikachō] yaku in many hanafuda games from Japan<!--as opposed to Korean and Hawaiian games-->, including [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) and [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken).

## Blue Ribbon
![101.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/101.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Maple with Blue Ribbon** [牡丹に青短, *botan ni aotan*] is the Ribbon card of the Maple suit, and one of the three Blue Ribbons.

The Peony Ribbon combines with the [Peony Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony#blue-ribbon) and [Chrysanthemum Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#blue-ribbon) in a large number of games to form the yaku called "Blue Ribbons."
## Chaff
