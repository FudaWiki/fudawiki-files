Wisteria [藤 - ふじ, *fuji*] is the name of a suit in traditional hanafuda decks. It is generally taken to be the fourth suit, representing the month of April [四月 - しがつ, *shigatsu*] or the number 4. The cards in this suit all feature hanging wisteria vines with clusters of purplish flowers. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Wisteria suit features a Cuckoo [不如帰 - ほととぎす, *hototogisu*] in front of a red (usually crescent) moon.
