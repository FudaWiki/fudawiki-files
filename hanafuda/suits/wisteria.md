![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =25x)Wisteria [藤 - ふじ, *fuji*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the fourth suit, representing the month of April [四月 - しがつ, *shigatsu*] or the number 4. The cards in this suit all feature hanging wisteria vines with clusters of purplish flowers. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Wisteria suit features a Cuckoo [不如帰 - ほととぎす, *hototogisu*] in front of a red (usually crescent) moon.
# Cuckoo with Crescent Moon
![40.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/40.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) This card combines with the [Bush Warbler](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler) and [Geese](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#geese) in [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop) to form the valuable "Five Birds" yaku. When captured alongside the other three Wisteria cards, it forms the "Wisteria Stripe" yaku in [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi) and in some versions of [Six Hundred](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken). In many other games, this card plays no particular role other than for making generic Animal yaku.
# Plain Ribbon
![41.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/41.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)This card combines with the [Iris Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris#plain-ribbon) and [Bush Clover Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#plain-ribbon) in some games such as Go-Stop to form the "Grass Ribbons" yaku. In many other games such as [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) and Six Hundred it merely contributes to generic Ribbon yaku.
# Chaff
![42.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/42.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)![43.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/43.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)This suit, like most, has two Chaff cards. In some older [patterns](/en/hanafuda/patterns) such as [echigobana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/echigobana) each of these will feature half of the following *waka* poem, of dubious authorship.
