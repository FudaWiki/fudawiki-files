![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =25x)**Wisteria** [藤, *fuji*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the fourth suit, representing the month of April [4月, *shigatsu*] or the number 4. In Korean, the suit is commonly called Black Bush Clover [흑싸리, *heuk-ssari*] instead.

The cards in this suit all feature hanging wisteria vines with clusters of purplish flowers. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Wisteria suit features a Cuckoo [不如帰, *hototogisu*] in front of a red (usually crescent) moon.

![40.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/40.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) This card combines with the [Bush Warbler](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler) and [Geese](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#geese) in [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop) to form the valuable "Five Birds" yaku. When captured alongside the other three Wisteria cards, it forms the "Wisteria Stripe" yaku in [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi) and in some versions of [Six Hundred](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken). In many other games, this card plays no particular role other than for making generic Animal yaku.

The crescent moon is a relatively recent addition. Edo-period cuckoo cards did not have a background at all, and in the early Meiji era red clouds were added, which turned into a moon when the [Hachi-Hachi-Bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana) pattern established itself.

## Plain Ribbon
![41.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/41.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x)This card combines with the [Iris Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris#plain-ribbon) and [Bush Clover Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#plain-ribbon) in some games such as Go-Stop to form the "Grass Ribbons" yaku. In many other games such as [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) and Six Hundred it merely contributes to generic Ribbon yaku.
## Chaff

In some older [patterns](/en/hanafuda/patterns) such as [echigobana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/echigobana) each of these will feature half of the following *waka* poem, of dubious authorship.

# Cultural significance
Cuckoos tend to migrate to Japan in the fourth month of the old lunar calendar (or around the start of May in the modern calendar), and their calls can first be heard when wisterias are in bloom. Because of this, wisterias and cuckoos have long been mentioned together in Japanese poetry about early summer. (On their own, wisteria is a [seasonal word [季語, *kigo*]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigo) that indicates that a poem takes place in late spring or the third month of the lunar calendar, while the cuckoo indicates any summer month.)

Because wisterias are long-lived and can grow in poor soil, it was considered an auspicious plant. It is in the name and heraldry of the Fujiwara clan, the most powerful noble family in a lot of Japanese history. A lot of common Japanese family names still have the kanji for wisteria in them, often because they are descendants of the Fujiwara clan.

Several Japanese sources claim that the moon on the cuckoo card is a reference to the 81st poem of the [Hyakunin Isshu](https://fudawiki.org/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) anthology, by the poet Tokudaiji Sanesada. It reads “when I turned my gaze to where the cuckoo sung, all that remained was the morning moon.”  Several English sources claim instead that it is a reference to the story of Yorimasa in the [Heike Monogatari.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Heike) When receiving his reward for slaying a monster, a cuckoo flies over and he composes a symbolic poem about a cuckoo and a crescent moon.
