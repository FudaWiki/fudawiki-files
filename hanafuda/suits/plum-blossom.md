Plum Blossom [梅 - うめ, *ume*] is the name of a suit in traditional hanafuda decks. It is generally taken to be the second suit, representing the month of February [二月 - にがつ, *nigatsu*] or the numeral 2. The cards in this suit all feature plum blossom trees. There are two Chaff cards, one Poetry Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Plum Blossom suit features a Japanese bush warbler [鴬 - うぐいす, *uguisu*] (sometimes also called a nightingale) perched on the branch of a plum blossom tree.
