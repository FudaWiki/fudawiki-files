![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =25x)**Bush Clover** [萩, *hagi*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the seventh suit, representing the month of July [7月,	*shichigatsu*] or the number 7.

The cards in this suit all feature green and red bush clover fronds. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Bush Clover suit features an orange Boar [猪, *inoshishi*] emerging from the bush.

Due to its somewhat ambiguous appearance, this suit is also known by various alternative names in Japanese, including ‘Red Beans’ [赤豆, *akamame*] and ‘Red Fruit’ [赤実, *akami*].

# Cards
## Boar
![70.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/70.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Bush Clover with Boar** [萩に猪, *hagi ni inoshishi*], or simply **Boar**, is the Animal card of the Bush Clover suit.

This card is part of the famous "Boar-Dear-Butterflies" [猪鹿蝶, inoshikachō] yaku in many hanafuda games from Japan<!--as opposed to Korean and Hawaiian games-->, including [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) and [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken).

## Plain Ribbon
![71.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/71.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) **Bush Clover with Ribbon** [萩に短冊, *hagi ni tanzaku*] is the Ribbon card of the Bush Clover suit.

This card combines with the [Wisteria Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria#plain-ribbon) and [Iris Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris#plain-ribbon) to form the "Grass Ribbons" yaku in many games, including [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken), and [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/video-games/ds/go-stop-ds). In other games such as [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) and [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) it merely contributes to generic Ribbon yaku.

## Chaff
