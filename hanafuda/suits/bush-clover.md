Bush Clover [萩 - はぎ, *hagi*] is the name of a suit in traditional hanafuda decks. It is generally taken to be the seventh suit, representing the month of July [七月	- しちがつ,	*shichigatsu*] or the numeral 7. The cards in this suit all feature green and red bush clover fronds. There are two Chaff cards, one Plain Ribbon, and one Animal. The Animal card of the Bush Clover suit features an orange boar emerging from the bush.
