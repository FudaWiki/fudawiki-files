Bamboo [竹 - たけ, *take*] is the name of an extra [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in certain extended [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It may represent the number 13 or the concept of Earth (as opposed to [Heaven](/en/hanafuda/suits/lotus)). The distribution of cards in the Bamboo suit differ depending on the deck in question. In 13-suit decks, this suit generally consists of one Chaff, one Ribbon, one Animal card (one or more Sparrows), and one Bright (either a Statue or a Tiger). In 14-suit decks, it contains instead two Chaffs, one Ribbon, and one Animal (a Tiger).
