Bamboo [竹 - たけ, *take*] is the name of an extra [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in certain extended [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It may represent the number 13 or the concept of Earth (as opposed to Heaven). The distribution of cards in the Bamboo suit differ depending on the deck in question. In 13-suit decks, this suit generally consists of one Chaff, one Ribbon, one Animal card (one or more Sparrows), and one Bright (either a Statue or a Tiger). In 14-suit decks, it contains instead two Chaffs, one Ribbon, and one Animal (a Tiger).
