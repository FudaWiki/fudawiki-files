It is generally taken to be the third suit, representing the month of March [三月	- さんがつ	*sangatsu*] or the number 3. The cards in this suit all feature red and pink cherry blossoms. There are two Chaff cards, one Poetry Ribbon, and one Bright. The Bright card of the Cherry Blossom suit features a curtain [幕 - まく, *maku*] on the lower half of the card, behind which one can infer the presence of people viewing the beautiful cherry blossoms.
