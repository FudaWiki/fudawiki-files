![Icon for month 3](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =25x)Cherry Blossom [桜 - さくら, *sakura*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the third suit, representing the month of March [三月	- さんがつ	*sangatsu*] or the number 3. The cards in this suit all feature red and pink cherry blossoms. There are two Chaff cards, one Poetry Ribbon, and one Bright. The Bright card of the Cherry Blossom suit features a curtain [幕 - まく, *maku*] on the lower half of the card, behind which one can infer the presence of people viewing the beautiful cherry blossoms.
# Flower Viewing Curtain
![30.svg](/sheldonchen-cards/30.svg#float-right,hanafuda-card =150x) The Curtain is of great value in [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), as it can be used in conjunction with the [Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup) for a quick victory, as well as being useful to make the valuable series of Bright yaku. It is also particularly useful in a wide array of other games due to its high point value and the variety of yaku that it forms.

In both [Six Hundred](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken) and [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi), it combines with the other Bright cards to form the most valuable yaku in each game ("Four Brights" and "Five Brights," respectively). It also combines with the [Crane](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun) and [Bush Warbler](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler) to make "Three Brights," (also known as "Big Three") in both games.

In Six Hundred, when captured alongside the other cards of its suit, it forms "Cherry Blossom Stripe," and when captured with the Sake cup, forms "Flower Viewing Sake."
