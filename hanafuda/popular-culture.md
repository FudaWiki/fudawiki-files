A list of popular media that contains Hanafuda. Intentionally excluded from this list are video games where playing a Hanafuda game is the primary purpose (e.g. Koi-Koi Japan) and video games that are presented as a collection of games where one of the games is a Hanafuda game (e.g. 51 Worldwide Games). For more information on such video games, please view the [Hanafuda Video Game list](/en/hanafuda/video-games).

# Significant Role
Media in which Hanafuda plays a significant role.

* [Summer Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wars) (サマーウォーズ, <i>Samā Wōzu</i>).
  A 2009 Japanese animated sci-fi film.  
  [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) is played to settle an important plot point.
  
# Included as a minigame
Video games (that are not collections of games) where hanafuda or a hanafuda-derived game is used as a minigame, often by playing it against other characters in the video game.

* Many games in the [Yakuza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)) franchise have a [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) minigame.

* Multiple games in the [Sakura Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakura_Wars) franchise have a [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) minigame.

* [Neopets Godori](http://www.neopets.com/games/godori/index.phtml)
  A simplified version of the Korean game [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop) is available to play. The deck has the same structure as standard hanafuda but features completely redone Neopets-themed artwork.

* [Tales of Berseria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Berseria) "Character Cards" minigame
	This installment in Namco's "Tales" series features a minigame that is a modified interpretation of [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi). It uses a modified deck structure of 8 suits of 6 cards each, with 7 different categories of cards. Each suit features character portraits from one installment in the video game series.
