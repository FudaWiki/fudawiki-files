A list of popular media that contains Hanafuda. Intentionally excluded from this list are video games where playing a Hanafuda game is the primary purpose (e.g. Koi-Koi Japan) and video games that are presented as a collection of games where one of the games is a Hanafuda game (e.g. 51 Worldwide Games). For more information on such video games, please view the [Hanafuda Video Game list](/en/hanafuda/video-games).
