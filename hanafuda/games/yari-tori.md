**Yari-Tori** (遣り取り, lit. 'give and take') is a quick gambling game played with the 6 "dead cards" set aside during the deal in [Tensho](/en/hanafuda/games/tensho). It is a game for **2 players**, and is closely related to the game [Tokotoko](/en/hanafuda/games/tokotoko).

# Setup
First, prepare the deck as you would for Tensho or [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana) by removing the 3 Chaff of [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia), leaving a deck of 45 cards. 

As a **side-game to Tensho, the 6 "dead cards" set aside during the deal will be used for a 2-player game of Yari-Tori** at the conclusion of the round. Then, **3 cards are dealt to each player**.
# Gameplay
Once both players have looked at their hands, players come to an agreement as to how much money to bet; **all players must put up the same amount before the game can progress.**

Once all players have put up the appropriate amount of money, **each player then chooses any 1 of the 3 cards in their hand that they want to *exchange* to the other player**, and then the players exchange cards, and proceed to the showdown.

**The winner is the player whose hand has the highest value in the ones digit when the 3 card values are summed.** That player earns all the money that was wagered. In the case of a tie, the pot may be split evenly among the winners.

Note that **the card values follow the [Nagoya suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits)** used in such games as [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko) and [Isuri](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko#isuri-hiyoko-variant). For instance, [![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine) cards have a value of 1, while the [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) counts as a 6, and [![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)Peony](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony) cards each count as 11. **Only the suit order matters, not any other characteristics of the card.**
