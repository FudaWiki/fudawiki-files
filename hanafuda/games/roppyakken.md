Six-Hundred [六百間, ろっぴゃっけん *roppyakken*] is a hanafuda game for 2 or 3 players. Unlike many games, which may last a dozen rounds, Six-Hundred tends to be over in less than 3 hands due to its scoring system. Some unique characteristics of the game include its usage of the Rain Man or Lightning card (depending on house rules) as a wild card, and its treatment of the Plum Blossom Animal card as similarly valuable to a Bright card.
