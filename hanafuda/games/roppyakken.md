Six Hundred - 六百間 \[ろっぴゃっけん, \*roppyakken\*\] is a \[hanafuda\](/en/hanafuda) \[game\](/en/hanafuda/games) for 2 or 3 players. Unlike many games, which may last a dozen rounds, Six Hundred tends to be over in less than 3 hands due to its scoring system. Some unique characteristics of the game include its usage of the \[!\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Rain Man\](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) as a wild card and its treatment of the \[!\[monthicon\_2.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_2.png =20x)Bush Warbler\](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler) card as a de-facto Bright card. Six Hundred was also introduced in Korea after World War II, and Koreans developed own scoring rules and variants. In Korea, the game is called \*'육백'\* (\*Yukbaek\* - 'Six Hundred' in Korean) or \*'삼봉'\* (\*Sambong\* - 'Three Peaks' in Korean). # Setup Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 \[おや, oya\], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. Any other house rules (such as which yaku to use and their values) should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair. ## The Deal Once the dealer has been selected, he or she shuffles the deck and sets up the table according to the number of players. If there are two participants, the dealer sends 8 cards face up to the table and 8 cards face down to each player. If three people are playing, the field will instead receive 6 cards and each player will receive 7. Any remaining cards in the deck will make up the draw pile. If a complete suit of 4 cards was dealt to the field, a misdeal is declared and the same player shuffles and deals anew. If all 4 cards of a suit were dealt to a player's hand, they have to declare a misdeal too (in some variants the player may choose to not declare a misdeal). If 3 cards of a suit were dealt to the field, they are stacked together to signify that they will all be captured whenever the fourth is played. Players then check their hands for any of the combinations described in the following section before the typical \[Hana Awase\](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase)-style gameplay begins. ## Lucky Hands (variant) There are three "Lucky Hands" - 手役 \[てやく, \*teyaku\*\] that one might be dealt in Six Hundred. If a player receives any of these combinations in their hand, they may reveal all cards that are part of that combination at the beginning of the round to earn points, according to the following chart. Using Lucky Hands yaku must be agreed upon before the game. |Value|Name of Lucky Hand|Description| |:---:|:---:|:---| |400|\*\*All Chaff\*\*  
総ガス \[そうがす, \*sōgasu\*\]|All cards in hand are 0-point cards. Note that this excludes the \[!\[monthicon\_12.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia\](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff), which is worth 10 points in this game. |200|\*\*Hand Three\*\*  
手三 \[てさん, \*tesan\*\]|Hand contains at least three cards of one suit.| |400|\*\*Double Hand Three\*\*  
二手三 \[ふたてさん, \*futatesan\*\]|Hand contains at least three of a kind in two different suits. Overrides Hand Three. > While \*Hand Three\* and \*Double Hand Three\* are mutually exclusive, either of them can \*\*stack\*\* with \*All Chaff\*. {.is-info} # Gameplay Once any Lucky Hands have been revealed and scored, players re-conceal their hands and begin the round. The dealer is the first to play, after which play moves counterclockwise until each player has exhausted their hands. ## Turns On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table. \* \*\*If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table\*\*, then the cards \*match\*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile. \* \*\*If the played card matches with two cards on the table\*\*, then the player may choose which one they capture. \* \*\*If the played card matches \*three\* cards on the table\*\*, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round. \* \*\*If the played card does not match any card\*\*, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards. > If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player \*must\* capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table. {.is-warning} > As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should \*\*be kept face-up and laid out on the table\*\*, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (Brights, Animals, Ribbons, and Chaff) to make detecting yaku easier. {.is-warning} After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion. After both cards have been played- one from the player's hand, and one from the draw pile- the turn ends, and the next player takes their turn. ## Wild Card The !\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Rain Man card functions as a (limited) wild card in Six Hundred. This means that it can be used to match any card \*\*other\*\* than 0-point cards or other \[!\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Willow\](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards. The exception is when the other three !\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Willow cards are all on the field; then it will capture all of them. In addition, the !\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Rain Man \*\*cannot\*\* be used to capture sets of 3 of any other suit. If the wild card is on the field it may be captured using another !\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Willow card, \*\*or\*\* using any non-0-point card (this wild capture might not be allowed in some variants). ## End of Round The current round ends when all players have used up their cards. If there are any cards left on the field at this point, they simply stay there and do not play any role in scoring. At this point, all players tally the total value of their captured cards, as well as check for any yaku made, according to the charts in the following sections. A player’s score for the round is calculated as the sum of their captured cards plus the value of any captured yaku, as follows: \`Player's Score = Player's Total Card Points + Total Value of Player's Yaku\`. If no player has reached 600 points, then the current scores are recorded, and a further round is played. \*\*Whoever scored the most points in the previous round becomes the dealer for the next round\*\*. ### End of Game The game ends once some player reaches at least 600 points, after playing as many rounds as necessary. This player is then the winner of the game. Should multiple players have a score of 600 or greater, then the winner is: - The player who captured the \*Four Brights\* yaku; - Failing that, the player who captured the \*Seven Ribbons\* yaku; - Or, failing that, whichever player has the highest total score. In the unlikely event of a tie, a further round may be played if desired. > Some rule sets many not recognise \*Four Brights\* or \*Seven Ribbons\* as instant wins. In these versions of the game, victory simply goes to whichever player has the highest score. {.is-info} # Card Values |Card Type|Value|Number in Deck| |:---:|:---:|:---:| |Brights|50|5| |\[!\[monthicon\_2.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_2.png =20x)Bush Warbler\](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler)|50|1| |Other Animals|10|8| |Ribbons|10|10| |!\[monthicon\_12.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia|10|1| |Other Chaff|0|23| ## Visual Representation |Value|Cards| |:---:|:---:| |50|\[!\[Pine With Crane\](/sheldonchen-cards/10.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun)\[!\[Plum Blossom with Bush Warbler\](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler)\[!\[Cherry Blossom with Curtain\](/sheldonchen-cards/30.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain)\[!\[Susuki Grass with Moon\](/sheldonchen-cards/80.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon)\[!\[Willow with Rain Man\](/sheldonchen-cards/110.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man)\[!\[Paulownia with Phoenix\](/sheldonchen-cards/120.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)| |10|\[!\[Pine With Poetry Ribbon\](/sheldonchen-cards/11.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#poetry-ribbon)\[!\[Plum Blossom with Poetry Ribbon\](/sheldonchen-cards/21.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#poetry-ribbon)\[!\[Cherry Blossom with Poetry Ribbon\](/sheldonchen-cards/31.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon)\[!\[Susuki Grass with Geese\](/sheldonchen-cards/81.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#geese)\[!\[Willow with Swallow\](/sheldonchen-cards/111.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#swallow)\[!\[Willow with Ribbon\](/sheldonchen-cards/112.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#plain-ribbon)\[!\[Paulownia with Yellow Bottom\](/sheldonchen-cards/121.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)\](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff)

No cards will be left in the deck if !\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Rain Man is not used as a wild, and there may be Triple Hand Threes. - The 2017 IndianWolf Studios book uses the \[!\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Lightning\](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) as the wild card. - In the Marguerite web game, the three \[Viewing\](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken#viewing-yaku) yaku are not counted if the player who scores them has also captured a !\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Willow card, unless they have also captured the \[!\[monthicon\_1.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_1.png =20x)Crane with Sun\](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun). - The MocoGame iOS version of Six Hundred takes place over 12 rounds, with the ultimate winner being the one who has exceeded 600 points the most times in that period. # Korean Variants Korean variants use different scoring rules after the end of a round, and Dandruff does not exist. Also, some yaku-related rules are different. - In Yukbaek variant, Four Bright yaku also requires \[!\[monthicon\_2.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_2.png =20x)Bush Warbler\](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler), and to complete Seven Ribbons there must be \[!\[monthicon\_11.png\](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon\_11.png =20x)Willow Ribbon\](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#plain-ribbon). Both yakus are considered as an automatic win regardless of the score (the game ends when someone completes any of these two yakus). - In Yukbaek variant, the highest scoring player in a round subtracts the round score of the second highest scoring player in that round, then adds it to total game score. For example, when player A/B/C scores 600/320/0 points in a round, player A adds 280 points (600 - 320) in game score and other players get nothing. - In Sambong variant, the game uses original Japanese scoring rule but scores are rounded up to 100. For the example above, player A/B/C gets 600/400/0 points. Also, Four Brights / Seven Ribbons do not end the game, instead they score 600 ~ 1000 points / 700 points + 100 points per additional ribbon. - Sambong variant adopts Hand Three (Yukbaek variant does not use hand yakus) and counts Hand Fours as a 300-points yaku too, but does not count All Chaffs as a yaku. - Player may play a longer game by setting the score limit to 800 in Yukbaek variant, or playing by rounds in Sambong variant. # Korean Additional Yakus In some regions additional Ribbon yakus are used. |Value|Name of Yaku|Composition| |:---:|:---:|:---| |300|\*\*Boar, Deer, Butterfly Ribbons\*\*
