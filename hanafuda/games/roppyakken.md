Six Hundred [六百間, ろっぴゃっけん *roppyakken*] is a [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) game for 2 or 3 players. Unlike many games, which may last a dozen rounds, Six Hundred tends to be over in less than 3 hands due to its scoring system. Some unique characteristics of the game include its usage of the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) as a wild card and its treatment of the [![monthicon_2.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x)Plum Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom) Animal card as a de-facto Bright card.
# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, oya], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. Any other house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.
## The Deal
Once the dealer has been selected, he or she shuffles the deck and sets up the table according to the number of players. If there are two participants, the dealer sends 8 cards face up to the table and 8 cards face down to each player. If three people are playing, the field will instead receive 6 cards and each player will receive 7. Any remaining cards in the deck will make up the draw pile.

If a complete suit of 4 cards was dealt to the field, a misdeal is declared and the same player shuffles and deals anew. If all 4 cards of a suit were dealt to a player's hand, they have the **option** of declaring a misdeal, with the same results.

If 3 cards of a suit were dealt to the field, they are stacked together to signify that they will all be captured whenever the fourth is played.

Players then check their hands for any of the combinations described in the following section before the typical [Hana Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase)-style gameplay begins.
## Lucky Hands
There are three commonly used "Lucky Hands" [手役 - てやく, *teyaku*] that one might be dealt in Six Hundred. If you receive any of these combinations in your hand, reveal all cards that are part of that combination at the beginning of the round to earn points, according to the following chart.
|Value|Name of Lucky Hand|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|400|All Chaff [総ガス - そうがす, *sōgasu*]|All cards in hand are 0-point cards. Note that this excludes the [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff), which is worth 10 points in this game.
|200|Hand Three [手三 - てさん, *tesan*]|Hand contains at least three cards of one suit.|
|400|Double Hand Three [二手三 - ふたてさん, *futatesan*]|Hand contains at least three of a kind in two different suits. Overrides Hand Three.
# Gameplay
Once any Lucky Hands have been revealed and scored, players re-conceal their hands and begin the round. The dealer is the first to play, after which play moves counterclockwise until each player has exhausted their hands.
Turns
## Turns
On your turn, choose one card from your hand to play to the field. If it matches suits with one card on the field, overlap the two, indicating that you will capture those cards. If it matches suits with two cards on the field, choose one of those two to capture with your card. If your played card matches 3 cards on the field, all 4 will be captured. If your played card does not have any matches on the field, it will simply become a field card.

After playing a card from your hand and making a match as is appropriate, flip over the top card from the deck and play it to the field in the same manner as above, again making a match by suit if possible. Once you have played a card both from your hand and the deck, collect any cards captured into your scoring area. It is a good idea (or in some rule sets, required) to keep your scoring area categorized by card type.
## Wild Card
The ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man card functions as a (limited) wild card in Six Hundred. This means that it can be used to match any card **other** than 0-point cards or other [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards. The exception is when the other three ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow cards are all on the field; then it will capture all of them. In addition, the ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man **cannot** be used to capture sets of 3 of any other suit.

If the wild card is on the field, you may capture it using any non-0-point card **or** using another ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow card.
## End of Round
The current round ends when all players have used up their cards. If there are any cards left on the field at this point, they simply stay there and do not play any role in scoring.

At this point, all players tally the total value of their captured cards, as well as check for any yaku made, according to the charts in the following sections. A player’s score for the round is calculated as the sum of their captured card plus the value of any captured yaku. If no player has reached 600 points, the current scores are recorded, to be added to the results of the next round.

Once one or more players' cumulative scores have reached or exceeded 600 points, the player with the greatest number of points is declared the winner. (The possible exception to this is if one of the instant win yaku have been formed.)

# Typical Yaku
Note that as with most [Hana Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase)-style games, there is some variation in the repertoire of yaku and their scores, depending on who you ask. The following table therefore may include yaku not present in other sources, or may be missing yaku that are included in other sources.
|Value|Name of Yaku|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|<h2 align="center">Bright Yaku</h2>|||
|600|Four Brights - 四光 [しこ, *shiko*]|The [![monthicon_1.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun), [![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain), [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon), and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix). In some rule sets, Four Brights is considered an instant win, even if another player had a greater final score.|
|150|Pine, Paulownia, Baldy - 松桐坊主 [まつきりぼうず, *matsu-kiri-bōzu*]|The ![monthicon_1.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane, ![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix, and ![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Moon.|

|<h2 align="center">Ribbon Yaku</h2>|||
|600|Seven Ribbons - 七短 [ななたん, *nanatan*]|Any 7 Ribbon cards. In some rule sets, the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#plain-ribbon) does not count towards this yaku, while in others it does. Seven Ribbons may also count as an instant victory, but loses to Four Brights if both are captured by different players.|
|100|Little Three - 小三 [こざん, *kozan*]| The three Poetry Ribbons: [![monthicon_1.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#poetry-ribbon), [![monthicon_2.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x)Plum Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#poetry-ribbon), and [![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Cherry Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon).|
|100|Blue Ribbons - 青短 [あおたん, *aotan*]|The three Blue Ribbons: [![monthicon_6.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)Peony](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony#blue-ribbon), [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Chrysanthemum](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#blue-ribbon), and [![monthicon_10.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_10.png =20x)Maple](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple#blue-ribbon).|
|100|Grass Ribbons- 草短 [くさたん, *kusatan*]|Three **Specific** Plain Ribbons: [![monthicon_4.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria#plain-ribbon), [![monthicon_5.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)Iris](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris#plain-ribbon), and [![monthicon_7.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Bush Clover](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#plain-ribbon).|
|<h2 align="center">Animal Yaku</h2>|||
|300|Boar, Deer, Butterfly - 猪鹿蝶 [いのしかちょう, *inoshikachō*]|The [![monthicon_7.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Boar](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#boar), [![monthicon_10.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_10.png =20x)Deer](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple#deer), and [![monthicon_6.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)Butterfly](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony#butterflies) cards.|

Note that this yaku replaces the other two Sake Yaku; you do not score for all three individually.
|100|Flower Viewing - 花見 [はなみ, *hanami*]|The ![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup and ![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain.

# Notable Variants
- The 2017 IndianWolf Studios book uses the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) as the wild card.
- In the Marguerite web game, the three [Sake](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken#sake-yaku) yaku are not counted if the player who scores them has also captured a ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow card, unless they have also captured the [Crane with Sun](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun).
- The MocoGame iOS version of Six Hundred takes place over 12 rounds, with the ultimate winner being the one who has exceeded 600 points the most times in that period.
