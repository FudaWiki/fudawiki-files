Six-Hundred [六百間, ろっぴゃっけん *roppyakken*] is a hanafuda game for 2 or 3 players. Unlike many games, which may last a dozen rounds, Six-Hundred tends to be over in less than 3 hands due to its scoring system. Some unique characteristics of the game include its usage of the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) or [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) card (depending on house rules) as a wild card, and its treatment of the [![monthicon_2.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x)Plum Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom) Animal card as similarly valuable to a Bright card.
