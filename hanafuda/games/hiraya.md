**Hiraya** [ひらや] is a [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for 3 players.

The game has only 1 Teyaku, which shares the same name as the game.

# Setup
Choose a dealer like usual. The dealer deals 7 cards to each player and 6 cards on the field, and the rest are put on the table face down as the draw pile.

If there are either 3 Willows or 4 cards of the same month on the field, then a **misdeal** is declared, and the cards are reshuffled and redealt.

# Teyaku - "Hiraya"
**Hiraya** is the same as **Karasu** in [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi): 7 Chaff cards in hand.

> For the purposes of all Yaku in this game, Willow cards are **not** considered Chaff.
{.is-warning}

After the cards are dealt, each player checks the cards in hand for this Teyaku. If a player has this Teyaku, they must **expose** their hand, then the player is paid **30 points** by each of the other 2 players.

After the points have been paid, the player hides their cards again, and the round begins.

# Gameplay
Gameplay is the same as in Hana-awase: Play until players run out of cards in hand.

## Wild Card
The Lightning card is considered a wild card in this game, and it can be used to capture a card of any suit, including Willow.

- If a player has it in hand, it can be used at any time.
- If it was drawn from the draw pile, it must be used to capture a card on the field. The only exception is if the field is empty.
- If it is on the field, then players are **not allowed to discard cards** from the hand or the draw pile; **instead, the wild card must be captured**. Otherwise, players may choose to capture other matching cards on the field.

## Leftovers
At the end of the round, there will be two cards left on the field: A Willow card, and a card of the same suit as the card captured by the Wild Card.

**Both of these cards belong to the player who used the Wild Card.**

> If the Wild Card is used to capture a Willow card, then there will be no leftovers.

# Scoring
## Card Points
Card Points are standard except Chaff are worth 0 points.

Players count the total of their card points and subtract **80 points** from it.

## Dekiyaku
After the card point calculations are done, players check if they have dekiyaku.
The other two players pay the player points for each dekiyaku the player has.

All Dekiyaku **stack** except for the Brights Yaku.

## Settlement
The total amount of points gained or lost by each player at the end of the round will be given by the following:

`Player's Score = (Player's Total Card Points - 80) + (Total Value of Player's Yaku x (Number of Players - 1)) - Total Value of All Opponents' Yaku`

The player with the highest score at the end of the round becomes the dealer for the next round. In the event of a tie, the player who was earliest in the turn order becomes the dealer.

# End of Game
There is no limit to how many rounds the game can be played for. Players must agree beforehand how many rounds they must play the game for, or if they want to play indefinitely until they choose to stop playing or somebody runs out of points.
