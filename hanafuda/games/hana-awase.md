Hana-Awase [花合わせ - はなあわせ, lit. "joining together flowers"] may refer to a number of related but differing games, depending on the time period of the reference. It may be considered the basis on which the many other fishing games are built; indeed, the name 'Hana-Awase' sometimes appears as a catch-all term to denote any game in which players capture cards on the table by matching them.

The game described here is a basic fishing game for two or three players. Points are scored mainly from the values of captured cards, with bonus points awarded for forming certain combinations - making it, in essence, [*Bakappana*](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) with yaku. It is typical of those given in more recent books under the title of 'Hana-Awase', or sometimes 'Matching Flowers'. While it is no doubt representative of the many games to which the label of *Hana-Awase* has been applied, it is far from definitive.
