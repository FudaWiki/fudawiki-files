Hana-Awase [花合わせ - はなあわせ, lit. "joining together flowers"] may refer to a number of related but differing games, depending on the time period of the reference. It may be considered the basis on which the many other fishing games are built; indeed, the name 'Hana-Awase' sometimes appears as a catch-all term to denote any game in which players capture cards on the table by matching them.

The game described here is a basic fishing game for two or three players. Points are scored mainly from the values of captured cards, with bonus points awarded for forming certain combinations - making it, in essence, [*Bakappana*](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) with yaku. It is typical of those given in more recent books under the title of 'Hana-Awase', or sometimes 'Matching Flowers'. While it is no doubt representative of the many games to which the label of *Hana-Awase* has been applied, it is far from definitive.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. Like many hanafuda games, a decision must also be made as to how many rounds to play - 12 rounds is traditional, though 6 and 3 are options for shorter games. Any other house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

## Choosing the Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the dealer. A hanafuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

## Distributing the Initial Cards
In the three-player version of the game, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards face-up to the table. In the two-player version, 8 cards are dealt to each player, and a further 8 cards face-up to the table. The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

There is no required order for dealing the cards, though certain traditional conventions exist. With two players, the dealer typically deals 4 cards to the opponent, 4 to the table, 4 to themselves, then repeats. Sometimes this is done in packets of two instead of four.

With three players, the usual order is for the dealer to give 4 cards to each player in an anti-clockwise order, 3 to the table, 3 to each player, then 3 to the table again.
