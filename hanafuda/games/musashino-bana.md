**Musashino-bana** [武蔵野花] is an attested Hanafuda fishing game that was thought to be played during the Edo period.

Originally having no name, the game was termed "Musashino" by Yasumasa Otsuka, a hanafuda researcher, after an old term for hanafuda decks made during the Edo period.

The game can be played by 3 players, or 4 players playing in teams of 2. If playing in teams, then each team shares the same capture area.

It plays like a typical [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) game but without any card points or Teyaku. The unique feature of this game is in the names of the Dekiyaku, which seem to only make sense in the context of old hanafuda designs.

# Setup
 Like many hanafuda games, a decision must first be made as to how many rounds to play - 12 rounds is traditional, though 6 and 3 are options for shorter games. Any other house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

Also, there is no attested scoring system; however, since players only obtain points through forming Dekiyaku, it is assumed that the same scoring system for [Taiyaku](/en/hanafuda/games/taiyaku) was used.

## Equipment
A 48-card Hanafuda card deck is used, preferably an Echigobana deck, since it is closest to what kind of decks would be used during the old days.

## Choosing The Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the dealer. A hanafuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

The winner of the round becomes the dealer for the next round.

## Distributing The Initial Cards
After shuffling the deck, the cards are distributed.

In the three-player version of the game, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards face-up to the table.

In the four-player version of the game, either of the two can be used:
- 5 cards are dealt to each player, and 8 cards face-up to the table.
- 6 cards are dealt to each player, and no cards to the table.

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then a **misdeal** is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

# Gameplay
In each round, the dealer is the first to play, and turn to play passes anti-clockwise around the table. The gameplay is the same as in Hana-awase, and the round ends when either all players run out of cards in hand, or if a player forms an Insta-Win Dekiyaku.

## Storm Rule (Optional Rule)
There are two different ways to implement the Storm Rule:
- If a player captures the ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rainman or the ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card, **Any ![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Full Moon, ![Icon for month 3](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain, or ![Icon for month 3](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Cherry Blossom Poetry Ribbon** an opponent has **cannot be used to form a Dekiyaku** (i.e. whatever Yaku is formed using those cards will not be counted at the end of the round).
- If a player captures the ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rainman or the ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card, then an opponent's *Moon Viewing* and *Flower Viewing* Dekiyaku are invalidated.

## Sun Rule (If Storm Rule is used)
If a player used the Rainman or Lightning card as per the Storm Rule, if an opponent then captures the ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane, then the effects of the Rainman or Lightning card are invalidated.

## Scoring
If a player forms an Insta-Win Dekiyaku, the round stops immediately, and the player wins. The loser(s) must pay the winner 8 points.

> This amount is only assumed; it is not mentioned how many points an Insta-Win Dekiyaku is worth.
{.is-warning}

Otherwise, all players check for all Dekiyaku they formed, and calculate the total Dekiyaku points they have obtained.

The player with the **most Dekiyaku points wins**, and the loser(s) must pay the winner the **difference of their score to the winner**.

# Dekiyaku
Dekiyaku in this game are classified by their value and composition.

Note that all Yaku **stack**, except:
- If a Lightning card is added to Three Brights to form Four Brights, then only the points for Four Brights are counted.

Also, if an Insta-Win Yaku is formed, the winner receives points for the Insta-Win Yaku only.
