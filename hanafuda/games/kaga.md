Kaga [加賀] is a [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for **two players**, played in the Kaga province in the Hokuriku region of Japan.

The game is unique in that its list of Dekiyaku includes a Four-of-a-kind for each of the 12 months, and it seems that players were expected to form as many Four-of-a-kinds as possible, since only a few cards have card points on them.

# Determining the Dealer
The first dealer is determined like in any typical hanafuda game.

# Distributing the Initial Cards
The dealer deals 8 cards to each player and 8 cards on the field. 

If 4 cards of the same month appear on the field, it is a **misdeal**, and the dealer reshuffles the deck and deals again. 

# Checking for Teyaku
Each player then checks their hand for a Teyaku. If they have, they may choose to **expose** it to the other player to claim the points.

> Since it is a disadvantage to play with your hand exposed to the other player, a player may also choose not to expose the Teyaku. However, the player will not earn any points from a hidden Teyaku.

There are only 2 teyaku, and they both **stack**.

Each Teyaku is worth **100 points.**

|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---|
**Four of a Kind**<br/>手四 [てし, *teshi*]|Four cards from the same month.|
**Empty Hand**<br/>空素 [からす, *karasu*]|**Seven** Chaff cards.|

> Note that despite what its name suggests, "Empty Hand" refers to having at least **seven** Chaff cards in your hand, meaning the remaining 8th card in your hand could be any card.

# Gameplay
Gameplay is identical to Hana-awase, and the round ends when all players run out of cards.

# Scoring
The scoring is **cumulative** (there is no score settlement); every score obtained in each round adds to the total score of the player in the game.

A player's score for each round is calculated as follows:
`Player's Score = Card Points + Teyaku Points + Dekiyaku Points`

Then, the difference between the players' scores is calculated.

The player with the higher score **wins the score difference**.

**The winner of the round becomes the dealer of the next round.**

# Card Values
Only seven cards of a hanafuda deck have card points. Other cards are worth 0 points.
