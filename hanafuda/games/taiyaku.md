**Taiyaku** [大役], also known as Echigo-bana [越後花], is a local hanafuda game for 2 to 7 players, although it is best played with 4 or 5 players.  It features a huge list of Yaku (hence the name), and a fairly complicated payment system, which makes it suitable for cash gambling.

It was played in the Echigo Province (now Niigata Prefecture) in Japan, using a regional pattern of Hanafuda (also called Echigo-bana), although a standard Hanafuda deck may also be used.

# Preliminaries

## Equipment
**Hachi-Hachi was traditionally played with a regional 48-card hanafuda deck called "Echigo-bana".** This deck is structurally identical to a standard Hanafuda deck, and is only aesthetically different. The design of the cards are a copy of the old hanafuda patterns, with poems written on some of the Chaff cards; these poems have no gameplay purpose whatsoever. The deck only comes with a red back, so only 1 deck is needed for gameplay.

> A standard Hanafuda deck may be used, in the absence of an Echigo-bana deck.
{.is-warning}

A supply of poker **chips**, go stones, or other tokens—preferably in multiples of 8, and in a large quantity—will be required **for keeping track of scores**. Scores can be kept on paper if required, but can be trickier.

In addition, a different set of tokens or counters may be helpful for the calculation of Dekiyaku scores.

## Number of Players
As with other hanafuda fishing games like [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), Taiyaku only supports having two or three active players in each round. Other players may participate in the game, but at the beginning of each round, it must be determined who will play, and who will drop out. This is done via a kind of 'auction' vaguely reminscient of both the bidding phases found in western trick-taking games like Bridge, and the betting of Poker.

**For simplicity, these rules will describe the three-player version of the game first.** However, this is not to imply that Taiyaku is fundamentally *only* a three-player game, or that it works best with three players. The choice of whether to stay or drop out is an interesting and strategic one, and it is commonly claimed the game is more exciting with larger groups.

* **See [4 to 5 players added mechanics](#taiyaku-for-4-5-players)**
* **See [6 to 7 players adaptation](#taiyaku-for-6-7-players)**

# Setup (3 Players)
Game setup involves **choosing the dealer** [配り手, *kubari-te*], **preparing the chips**, **shuffling the deck**, **distributing the initial cards**, and **choosing who plays first**. As the game is designed for gambling, there is no attested limit to how many rounds should be played in a game, but it is recommended to adopt the typical hanafuda game standard of 12 rounds, one for each month of the year, although 6 round games (half a year) or even 3 round games (a season) may be played. Naturally, house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

This section describes game setup for three players; for more players, please see the ["number of players" section](#number-of-players).

## Choosing the Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the initial dealer. A hanafuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Preparing the Chips
Each player starts with an equal amount of chips for scoring.

At the beginning of each round, all players must take out **8 chips** from their total chips in hand. This is the ***bet limit*** of each player per round, and a player may not lose more than 8 chips during one round *(The purpose is so that a player may not lose a huge amount, if not all their chips during one round like in Hachi-hachi)*. 

## Dealing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the deck, and any other player may cut. Then, the dealer places 3 cards **face-down** to the table, and then, starting with the player to their right and moving counter-clockwise (↺), the dealer deals 4 cards to each player in turn. They then places a further 3 cards **face-down** to the table, and an additional 4 cards to each player.

**In total, 8 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards to the table face-down to form the field.**

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field to form the draw pile.

* If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then a misdeal is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

## Choosing Who Plays First
Unlike in typical hanafuda games, being the dealer doesn't guarantee that you get to play the first turn. Instead, the **player who will play the first turn** (hereinafter referred to as the **Leader** [親, *oya*]) is **chosen at the beginning of each round**, using a method similar to that used for choosing the dealer.

Starting with the dealer counter-clockwise, each player takes one card from the **field**, and reveals it. The player with the earliest month becomes the leader for that round. In case of a tie, the dealer or the player nearest to the dealer's right is chosen as the leader.

Once the leader is chosen, all taken cards are returned to the field, and then **all field cards are turned face-up**.


# Teyaku
Players then check their hands for *teyaku*, or 'hand combinations' [手役 - てやく, *teyaku*], and score points based on them.

Taiyaku has only 4 teyaku, and they are equally divided into two categories:

|Value (in chips)|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|<h2 align="left">Group A: Chaff Teyaku</h2><br>**Note**: For the purposes of these teyaku, the ![Icon for month 9](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup card is also considered as a Chaff.|||
|5|**Seven Empties**<br/>七空 [しちから, *shichikara*]|Seven Chaff cards.|
|7|**Eight Empties**<br/>八空 [はちから, *hachikara*]|Eight Chaff cards.|

|<h2 align="left">Group B: Set Teyaku</h2>|||
|5|**Four-of-a-Kind**<br/>手四 [てし, *teshi*]|Four cards from the same month.|
|5|**Two Four-of-a-Kinds**<br/>ふた手四 [ふたてし, *futateshi*]|During a 2-player match, this Teyaku is worth **8 points**.</br>During a 3-player match, this Teyaku is not worth more than a single Four-of-a-Kind.|


The teyaku within each group are mutually exclusive, meaning that **each player scores for their single most valuable teyaku in each of Groups A and B.** In order to claim their *teyaku*, a player must reveal all the relevant cards from their hand: 
* For teyaku in Group A, show all cards that are part of the combination. 
* For teyaku in Group B, only the Chaff cards need to be shown.

The points earned for *teyaku* are paid to a player by each of their two opponents, in typical zero-sum fashion.

>Remember that a player cannot lose more than 8 chips per round; if a player runs out of these chips, they don't have to pay for the shortage.
{.is-warning}

Once teyaku are claimed, the round begins, and the exposed cards remain exposed throughout the entire matching phase of the round. *(Keep the exposed cards separate from the other cards on the table. These are technically still part of your hand.)*

>*Should a player overlook certain teyaku, or otherwise forget to claim them, they have until the dealer takes the first card from the draw pile in order to do so. After this point, any unclaimed teyaku are void.*
{.is-warning}

# Gameplay (Matching Phase)
In each round, the **leader** is the first to play, and turn to play passes counter-clockwise (↺) around the table. The core gameplay and turn structure of Taiyaku is typical of games in the [*Hana-Awase*](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase#gameplay) family, with the only exception being the first turn.

## The First Turn
The leader plays a card from their hand like normal.

Then they **cut the draw pile in half, place the bottom half on top, and then draw a card from it**. The drawn card is then played like normal, and the leader's turn ends.

After the first turn, gameplay for all remaining turns during the round are identical to Hana-awase.

## *Dekiyaku* That Stop the Round
One a player has played their two cards—one from their hand, and one from the draw pile—they check the contents of their score pile to see if they have formed any *dekiyaku*, or 'built combinations' [出来役 - できやく, *dekiyaku*]. 

Similar to the *yaku* in other games, *dekiyaku* are certain valuable combinations of cards that the players seek to assemble in their scoring piles. A complete list of dekiyaku and their point values are given [further down the page](#dekiyaku).

Typically in Taiyaku, forming a dekiyaku does not stop the round. However, there are certain dekiyaku that *do stop* the round; The player who forms one **wins the round immediately and takes all chips from the other players.**

# End of Round and Scoring

The round ends either when all players run out of cards in their hands, or if a player forms a dekiyaku that stops the round.

If all players run out of cards in their hands, players then check all the dekiyaku they formed during the round and makes a total of all the dekiyaku values to obtain their score.

The player with the highest Dekiyaku score wins the round, and the loser(s) must pay chips to the winner equal to the difference of their score to that of the winner.

>Remember that a player cannot lose more than 8 chips per round; if a player runs out of these chips, they don't have to pay for the shortage.
{.is-warning}

# End of the Game
The game proceeds for as many rounds as were agreed upon—typically 12. Once all the rounds have been played, the player with the highest total score is the winner.

# Dekiyaku
Taiyaku is notable for its huge repertoire of *dekiyaku* compared to other *Hana-Awase* fishing games.

Each Dekiyaku are sorted into groups. Generally, all Dekiyaku within each group are **mutually exclusive**, with the exception of the Four-of-a-Kind yaku group and the Birds yaku group, with a few exceptions.

# Hachi-Hachi for Two Players
While Hachi-Hachi works best with a minimum of three players, it can be adapted for two players with a few adjustments. It may occasionally occur during a game with 4+ players if, during the drop-out phase, all but two players drop out.

The deal is the same as for three players- 7 cards in each player's hand, 6 on the field, and the remainder of the deck as a draw pile.

The game then proceeds as in the three player version. The field multiplier is determined, teyaku are claimed, the round is played, and scores are determined at the end. There are only two differences:

Firstly, special achievements are not recognised, and neither are *All Eights*, *Double Eights*, or *Sixteen Chaff*.

Secondly, if the round ends without any dekiyaku being formed, then the scoring is slightly different. While each player still counts their captured card points to determine the winner, comparing against the par value of 88 only makes sense with three players. Instead, the players calculate the following:

`Payment = (Winner's Total Card Points - Loser's Total Card Points) x Field Multiplier`

This amount is then paid to the winner by the loser.

# Hachi-Hachi for 4-6 Players
While only three players take part in any given round—using the rules as described above—it is entirely possible for 4-6 players to participate in the game as a whole. Indeed, many accounts consider it preferable to have a minimum of 4 players, since this introduces an additional drop-out phase at the beginning of each round and adds to the depth of the game.

*When playing with 4 or more people, not every player will participate in every round, so Hachi-Hachi with more than 3 people tends to be played for a full 12-round year at minimum. Campaign games are also seen, in which one full year is played for every person at the table! Whatever the case, the length of the game should be decided beforehand.*

## Initial Setup
The dealer is chosen as usual, and the cards are dealt to each player as previously described- 7 cards to each player and 6 to the field, with the remainder as the draw pile.

If 6 people are playing, then there will be nothing left of the deck to serve as a draw pile, but this will be remedied at the end of the dropout phase.

Misdeals are checked for, and the field multiplier is determined as usual.

Then, the players pick up their cards, and the dropout phase begins.

## The Dropout Phase
Each player then evaluates their hand to decide if they would like to play this round, or sit out.

Beginning with the dealer and moving anti-clockwise, each player announces if they would like to play, or drop out. This proceeds until three players have announced their intent to play, or until everyone has had their turn, whichever comes first.

To discourage needless dropping out, a *dropout penalty* [逃げ料 - にげりょう, *nige-ryou*] is imposed. The first player who chooses to drop out pays 1 *kan*. The second pays 1 and a half *kan*, the third pays 2 *kan*, and so on, with the fee increasing by half a *kan* each time. These payments are held in a pot, which will be claimed by the player who wins the round.

If fewer than three players wish to play, then the situation can be handled in various ways. If only two players wish to play, then they may either agree to split the pot evenly (in which case the round is considered over before it began, and the next round begins, presumably with the same dealer), or they may compete for its contents by playing a round of 2 player Hachi-Hachi.

If only one player wishes to play, then obviously no game can occur. This sole remaining player is the *de facto* winner of the round, and claims the entire contents of the pot.

If nobody wishes to play, then a misdeal is declared; the cards are thrown in and re-dealt.

> Some versions of the game require that three people play, no matter what. As soon as all but three players have dropped out, the remainder must participate in the round. Sometimes this restriction is only imposed in the later rounds of the game.
{.is-info}

As soon as three people decide to play, then any players who have not yet had their turn to decide are *forced out* [追い込み - おいこみ, *oikomi*]. Since these players may well have valuable hands that they were eager to play, they are paid *hand compensation* based on the value of their hand.

The total compensation is the sum of the following:
- Half the value of the hand's teyaku score.
- Half the value of any complete dekiyaku in the hand.
- 3 points for every card in the hand that contributes to either the *Five Brights*, *Poetry Ribbons*, *Blue Ribbons*, or *Boar, Deer, Butterflies* (if used) dekiyaku, and which are not already included in a teyaku or dekiyaku.

This compensation is paid to the player by each of the two *non-dealer* active players.

> Note that the field multiplier is determined before the dropout phase begins. Because, yes, it applies to dropout penalties and hand compensation as well.
{.is-warning}

> Since the dropout phase is a kind of prelude before the round 'officially' begins, note that dropout penalties and hand compensation are *not* cancelled by the exceptional circumstances of *All Eights*, *Double Eights*, or *Sixteen Chaff*.
{.is-warning}

If the dealer chooses to drop out, then the player to their right becomes the dealer for the round. If this player then drops out, the player to *their* right becomes the dealer, and so on.

> Some versions of the game allow a player who is *forced out* to barter with one of the players who decided to play, in order to buy them out of the game and play in their place. The minimum amount to be offered when trying to buy a player out should be at least the *hand compensation* value of that player's hand, though room for negotiation is possible.
{.is-info}

Once the active players have been determined, then the non-active players place their hands face-down on top of the draw pile. The draw pile should then probably be shuffled by one of the non-active players before play begins.

## Gameplay
Once the three active players are determined, the round is played exactly as described in the main bulk of this page. Teyaku are claimed, the hands are played, and scores are determined.

The winner of the round will claim the pot of dropout penalties, then the next round begins with a new dropout phase.

# Hachi-Hachi for 7 Players
While probably best with 4-6 people, Hachi-Hachi can be adjusted very simply to accommodate 7 players.

This tweak makes use of the additional blank card included with many hanafuda decks. The blank card is shuffled into the deck, then the dealer gives each player 7 cards. No cards are dealt to the field.

Whichever player holds the blank card must announce this fact. This player drops out, and takes no further part in the current round. They are not paid anything, nor do they pay anything to the other players (this includes dropout penalties, hand compensation, etc.).

The 6 non-blank cards in this player's hand are placed face-up on the table to become the field. Play then proceeds as in 6 player Hachi-Hachi. The blank card is set aside and plays no further part in the round. (I suggest using it as a dealer marker.)

# Variations and Additional Rules

## Dealer Hand Swap
After the cards are dealt, but before the players look at their hands, any player may ask to swap their hand for the dealer's hand. Accounts vary as to whether each player can do this only once, or as many times as desired.

> Note that you are swapping *for the dealer's hand*, not *with the dealer*. For example, if Player A calls to swap with the dealer, then other players must now call to swap with Player A, since they hold the dealer's hand.
{.is-info}

### Special Achievement: *Dealer's Hand*
If, at the end of the round, the player who held the dealer's hand has captured at least 89 total card points, then they are paid 1 *kan* by *all* other players, including the inactive ones (though not including the 7th player who was forced out by the blank card).

> As a special achievement, these payments are cancelled if any of *All Eights*, *Double Eights* or *Sixteen Chaff* occur.
{.is-info}

## *Mizuten*
After the cards are dealt, but before the players look at their hands, the dealer may declare their intent to play blind [不見転 - むずてん, *mizuten*]. Once this is declared, the dealer is committed to playing the round and may not drop out.

### Special Achievement: *Mizuten*
If the dealer, having declared their intent to play blind, manages to capture at least 89 card points by the end of the round, they are paid 1 *kan* by *all* other players, including the inactive ones (though not including the 7th player who was forced out by the blank card).

Conversely, if they fail to capture at least 89 card points, they must pay 1 *kan* to each of the other two active players.

> As a special achievement, these payments are cancelled if any of *All Eights*, *Double Eights* or *Sixteen Chaff* occur.
{.is-info}

## The Full Campaign
A full-length 'campaign' of Hachi-Hachi is typically played in the following manner, facilitated by the items found in a Hachi-Hachi play set.

These sets include go stones to serve as score tokens - black being 1 point, and white being 1 *kan* - along with baskets for each player to store them in. It also includes a number of *kanfuda*, or *kan* cards. These are small tokens bearing numbers - 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 being common ones - which are each worth their face value in *kan*.

At the beginning of the game, each player receives a starting number of points- for example, 25 *kan*- from the bank, which represents their *buy-in*.

Each player then immediately pays a pre-determined amount - for example, 5 *kan* - into a *prize pot* [褒美 - ほうび, *houbi*], which will be claimed by the final winner.

Hence, each player begins the game with an amount of go stones equal to their buy-in, minus the pot payment- in this example, 20 *kan*.

Play as many years (sets of 12 rounds) as there are players at the table. The play set includes a token shaped like a *war fan* to track the field multiplier, and a *mizuten* token to track when the dealer has gone in blind.

At the end of each round, the winner of the round puts 1 point in a dedicated pot, so that by the end of the year it will contain 12 points (1 *kan*, in the dozenal system). Often, this 'pot' is the lid of the box in which the play set is packaged, and possesses 12 small labelled intendations in which the stones are placed.

This 'pot' [番個板 - ばんこいた, *bankoita* (lit. 'round-counting board')] is used to help track the months, and at the end of the year its contents are given to the player with the fewest (or most, depending on source) total points.

Should a player run out of chips, they may borrow more from the bank. These loans come in fixed units, for example of 50 *kan*, and each is accompanied by a token indicating the debt. (In Nintendo play sets, these debt tokens are shaped like *daruma* dolls.)

The player with the highest total score at any point is known as *ginmi* [吟味 - ぎんみ, *ginmi*]. The play set includes a medal token, which is held by whichever player is currently *ginmi*. If a player is *ginmi* for three rounds in a row, they earn a bonus of 10 *kan* from each other player.

The player with the most total points at the end of the campaign is the winner. This player receives the contents of the prize pot. (in the event of a tie, this pot can be split.)

Lastly, debts must be settled. Each player subtracts their 25 *kan* buy-in (with an additional 50 *kan* subtracted for every debt token) to obtain their final scores.
