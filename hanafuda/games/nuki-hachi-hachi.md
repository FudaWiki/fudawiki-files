Nuki Hachi-hachi [抜き八八 - ぬきはちはち, lit. 'stripped eighty-eight'] is a [2-player](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#hachi-hachi-for-two-players) [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) variant using a stripped Hanafuda deck.

It can be played by 2-4 players, but only 2 players may play at once.

# Equipment
Only **34 cards** of a standard hanafuda deck are used. Remove all ![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x) Wisteria, ![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x) Iris, and ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x) Bush Clover cards, as well as 2 ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) Paulownia Chaff.

Go Stones are also helpful in keeping track of scores. Black and White stones are used, and 1 black stone = 1 point, while 1 white stone = 1 "kan". (see [here](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#a-note-on-scoring) for more details.)

Hachi-Hachi sets will include additional tokens for tracking things such as the field multiplier and *[mizuten](#Mizuten)* markers, along with pots for holding payments. None of these items are strictly necessary.

# Setup
## Choosing the Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the initial dealer. A hanafuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Dealing the Cards
**The dealing method is the same as in Hachi-hachi; 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards to the table face-up to form the field.**

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field to form the draw pile.

* If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then a **misdeal** is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

## Field Multiplier
Field Multipliers are the same as in Hachi-hachi, except the **Grand Field is omitted**.

|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|Small Field|A *small field* [小場 - こば, *koba*] occurs if there are no Brights on the field. Point exchanges are unaffected.|
|Large Field|A *large field* [大場 - おおば, *ooba*] occurs if any of the [![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane with Sun](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun), [![Icon for month 3](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Flower Viewing Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain), or [![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Full Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon) Brights are on the field. All point exchanges will be **doubled** for this round. If two or all of these brights appear on the field, then the subsequent rounds will be Large Fields as well, depending on the number of brights.|
