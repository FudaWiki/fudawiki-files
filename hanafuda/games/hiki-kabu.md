**Hiki-Kabu** [引きカブ] is a Kabufuda game for 2-10 players in which players bet on the value of their dealt cards, similar to most poker games.

It shares a slightly similar gameplay style with [Kachi-Kachi](/en/kabufuda/games/kachi-kachi).

# Equipment
Hiki-Kabu is played with a [*kabufuda*](/en/kabufuda) deck. This simple deck contains 40 cards, consisting of four identical series of the numbers 1 to 10.

Since kabufuda decks are somewhat uncommon, they are often emulated with a hanafuda deck by removing all November and December cards and assigning values to the remaining cards based on month order. So all January cards are 1, February cards are 2, and so on, up to October which is 10.

Alternatively, one can take an international 52-card deck and remove all Kings, Queens, and Jacks, leaving only the pip cards. Ignoring suits (and counting the Aces as 1), the result is exactly equivalent to a kabufuda deck.

Additionally, it is recommended to use chips or other small counters to keep track of bets and players' scores.

# Gameplay
For the initial hand, determine the dealer using a method of your choice. For subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand will deal the following hand. In the event of a draw, the dealer of the drawn hand will deal the following hand.

Before the game starts, determine the amount of chips for the *ante*, which is also equal to the *minimum bet size* a player can make.

## First Card

Each player then *antes* the agreed amount, and the dealer deals each player their first card face-up.

## Second Card

After the first card has been dealt to each player, the dealer then deals each player their second card face-down. This second card may only be looked at by the player who holds it. 

The combination of the first and second cards forms a player's hand.

Each player checks their own cards to determine the strength of their hand. Each player, starting from the dealer counter-clockwise, may request to add a 3rd card into their hand.

## Third Card
Players who asked for a 3rd card is dealt a 3rd card face-up by the dealer. 

## Betting Round
The dealer begins the hand with the option to make an opening bet equal to or greater than the *minimum bet size* or fold their hand. Continuing clockwise, each player then has the option to **match** the dealer's bet, **raise** it to double the amount, or **fold** their hand.

>If the dealer folds, the next player then has the option to make an opening bet or fold following the same rules. If all players except one fold, the last remaining player collects the pot without proceeding to *showdown*.

>If the bet is raised, then all other players who haven't folded must either match that bet, raise it even further, or fold.
{.is-info}

After all remaining players have placed equal bet amounts, they proceed to *showdown*.

## Showdown
Starting with the dealer (or closest player in order), each player reveals all their cards. Hands are evaluated according to the *Hand Rankings* chart below. The winner of the hand collects the pot and becomes the dealer for the next hand.

Depending on the hand, there will be a **multiplier** in the earnings of the winner; this will be applied to the bets of other players who participated in the showdown.

>In the case of a draw, the pot for the hand carries over to the next hand, and the dealer for the drawn hand deals the following hand. All players *ante* as normal for that hand.

# Hand Rankings
- Sequence of cards do not matter except for "Nobori" and "Kudari".

- If there are two players who have both Nobori or both Kudari, then the strength is determined by the *ones* digit of the sum of the cards.

- Also, 2-card hands are invalidated if a 3rd card is added.
