Koi-Koi [こいこい] is a popular hanafuda fishing game for two players, in which players compete to capture cards from the table and form scoring combinations known as *yaku*.

Its name comes from its gameplay element that allows players to decide whether to continue the round (by calling “*koi-koi*,” lit. "come on!") and risk their points for the chance to improve their score, or end the round (by calling “*shōbu*” [勝負 - しょうぶ], lit. "game" or "match") and keep the points they currently have.

Koi-Koi is among the best-known [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) [games](/en/hanafuda/games) outside of Japan, courtesy of its representation in numerous anime and video games.

This game may have developed as a simplification of the Korean game of [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop), which features similar scoring and the same risk-taking gameplay mechanic.

A word of caution: As one of the most popular hanafuda games, Koi-Koi exists in a truly *huge* range of variations, above and beyond most of the other games on this site. Indeed, it may be no exaggeration to say that there are as many house rules as there are houses!

As such, don't be surprised if the version here differs from what you may be used to. Many of these variations are collected at the end of the article.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

A decision must also be made as to how long the game will last - 12 rounds is traditional, though other common options are 6 rounds, 3 rounds, or as many rounds as it takes for one player to reach 50 points total. Conventionally, each round corresponds to a month of the year; the first round is January, the second February, and so on. 12 rounds is thus a *year*, 6 rounds a *half-year*, and 3 rounds a *season*.

Any other house rules should also be established at this point, in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Distributing the Initial Cards
Eight cards are distributed to each player, and eight to the table. While there is no required method for this distribution, it is common for the dealer to give four to their opponent, four to the table, four to themselves, and then repeat. Sometimes this is done in packets of two instead of four.

{.is-success}

*(Depending on the preferred rule set, if 4 cards of the same suit are dealt to the field at the beginning of a round, either a misdeal is declared and the same dealer shuffles and distributes cards once more, **or** the dealer automatically wins that round, usually receiving 6 points, and staying the dealer for the next round. The same may be true in the case that that 4 pairs of different suits are dealt to the field.*

*Some rules also have a provision for "lucky hands," in which either of the above situations are dealt to a player's hand rather than the field. In this case, the player who received the lucky hand earns the 6 points and becomes the dealer for the next round. Other rule sets may allow the recipient of such a hand to declare a misdeal, or may simply continue the game as usual.)*

## Checking for Lucky Hands
After the cards are dealt, each player checks if they possess any *lucky hands*, or *teyaku* [手役 - てやく]. There are only two Lucky Hands in Koi-Koi:

- **Four of a Kind** [手四 - てし, *teshi*]: All four cards of any given month.
- **Four Pairs** [喰付 - くっつき, *kuttsuki*]: Four pairs, a pair being two cards of the same month.

If a player holds one of these lucky hands, then they declare it. That player immediately wins the round, scoring 6 points and becoming dealer for the next round.

If both players hold a lucky hand, then the round is a draw. Nobody scores anything, and the next round begins with the same dealer.

If either of these lucky hands are **dealt to the table**, then a **misdeal** is declared. The cards are thrown in, re-shuffled, and re-dealt.

> Sources are vague on what should happen if a player holds *both* of the lucky hands. In some descriptions, they only score 6 points, but in others, the hands stack, and they score 12 points. Decide on this as a house rule before playing!
{.is-info}

> Despite the name, these 'lucky hands' are actually very poor when it comes to capturing cards. The points earned from them are compensation for bad luck!
{.is-info}

# Gameplay
Each round, the dealer is the first to play. Turn to play alternates.

## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.
* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player may choose which one they capture.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player ***must*** capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (Brights, Animals, Ribbons, and Chaff) to make detecting yaku easier.
{.is-warning}

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion.

## Checking for Yaku
After playing both their cards - one from their hand,and one from the draw pile - the player checks their score pile for *yaku* [役 - やく], or *scoring combinations*; a list of these is given further down the page.

- If the player has either formed a new *yaku*, or improved an existing one, then they have the choice to either end the round by calling *shōbu*, or to continue in pursuit of a higher score by calling *koi-koi*.

- If they have not, then their turn simply ends, and turn to play passes to the opponent. 

> Note that in many versions of the game, the [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup) may count towards both the Animals category **and** the Chaff category for making yaku.
{.is-info}

### Calling *"Koi-Koi"*
If the player declares *koi-koi*, then the round continues. Their turn ends, and turn to play passes to the opponent. This is a calculated risk; continuing the round allows the opportunity to capture more yaku, but forfeits all points should the opponent win first.

In many rulesets, each player may call *koi-koi* as many times as they desire during the round.

### Calling *“Shōbu”*
If the player declares *shōbu*, then the round immediately ends, and scores are calculated. This is a safe bet, which allows the player to immediately cash in on their yaku.

# End of Round and Scoring
The round ends when either a player calls *shōbu*, or when both players run out of cards in their hands.

## Exhaustive Draw
If both players run out of cards in hand without calling *shōbu*, the round ends in an *exhaustive draw*, and neither player earns any points. Note that caputed yaku **are not scored for**; if a player called *koi-koi* but did not subsequently improve their yaku and call *shōbu* before the cards ran out, then **their points are forfeit.**

The round is considered over, and the next round begins with the same dealer.

## Scoring for *Yaku*
Otherwise, the player who called *shōbu* calculates the total point value of all the yaku in their score pile. This total is their *base score*. Two multipliers are then applied:

- If the player's *base score* is greater than or equal to 7, then their score is doubled.

- If their opponent called *koi-koi* at any previous point during the round, then the player's score is doubled. (The exact number of times the opponent called *koi-koi* has no effect.)

The player's total score is then their base score, times any multipliers they may have earned.

Note that only **the player who called *shōbu*** earns any points. Their opponent **scores nothing** for this round.

## End of Game
Depending on the terms agreed upon during setup, the game ends after a certain number of rounds, or once a target score has been reached. If playing a certain number of rounds, the player with the greater score at the end of the last round is declared the winner. If playing to a target point total, the first to reach that score is the winner.

# Common Yaku
There is great variation in the possible sets of yaku in Koi-Koi. Some yaku may be house rules, while others are common to nearly all rule sets. In many cases, the point values of these yaku will change depending on source.

The yaku given here are fairly typical of modern forms of the game, as seen in video games and Nintendo's current Koi-Koi rules leaflet. They are sorted into groups. All of the yaku within each group (except “Ungrouped”) are *mutually exclusive*; a player only scores for their most valuable yaku in each group.

For example, if a player has all five Bright cards, they only earn points for *Five Brights*.  They do not earn points for *Four Brights*, *Rainy Four Brights*, or *Three Brights*. This goes for each grouping.

# Variations
As previously mentioned, Koi-Koi is utterly *abundant* with rules variations. There are most likely far more than we could ever
