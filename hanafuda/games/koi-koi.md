# Overview
Koi-Koi [こいこい] is among the best-known hanafuda games outside of Japan. It is a fishing-type game for two players. Its name comes from its gameplay element that allows players to decide whether to continue the round (by calling “koi-koi,” lit. "come on!") and risk their points for the chance to improve their score, or end the round (by calling “shōbu” [勝負 - しょうぶ]) and keep the points they currently have.

This game seems to have developed as a simplification of the Korean game of Go-Stop, which features similar scoring and the same risk-taking gameplay mechanic.
# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, oya], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.
## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in Hanafuda is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.
## Distributing the Initial Cards
Eight cards are distributed to each player, and eight to the table. While there is no required method for this distribution, it is common for the dealer to give four to their opponent, four to the table, four to themself - and then repeat.
# Common Yaku
There are many variations of yaku [役, やく] in Koi-Koi.  Some may be house-rules while others are popular throughout.  In many cases, the point values of these yaku will change depending on the provided rules.

Yaku listed below are sorted into groups.  For each of these groups (except “Ungrouped”), only one point value is valid for a set.  For example, if you have all five Bright cards, you get the points for “Five Brights”.  You do not get the points for “Five Brights and Four Brights and Rainy Four Brights." This goes for each grouping. You receive the highest points you're allowed based on the cards captured.
