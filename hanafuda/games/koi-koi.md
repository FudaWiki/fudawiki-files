Koi-Koi [こいこい] is among the best-known hanafuda games outside of Japan. It is a fishing-type game for two players. Its name comes from its gameplay element that allows players to decide whether to continue the round (by calling “koi-koi,” lit. "come on!") and risk their points for the chance to improve their score, or end the round (by calling “shōbu” [勝負 - しょうぶ], lit. "game" or "match") and keep the points they currently have.

This game seems to have developed as a simplification of the Korean game of Go-Stop, which features similar scoring and the same risk-taking gameplay mechanic.
# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, oya], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. A decision must also be made as to how long the game will last - common options are 6 rounds, 12 rounds, or as many rounds as it takes for one player to reach 50 points total.
## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.
## Distributing the Initial Cards
Eight cards are distributed to each player, and eight to the table. While there is no required method for this distribution, it is common for the dealer to give four to their opponent, four to the table, four to themself - and then repeat.
# Gameplay
Each round, the dealer is the first to play.
## Turns
On your turn, choose one card from your hand to play to the field. If it matches suits with one card on the field, overlap the two, indicating that you will capture those cards. If it matches suits with two cards on the field, choose one of those two to capture with your card. If your played card matches 3 cards on the field, all 4 will be captured. If your played card does not have any matches on the field, it will simply become a field card.

After playing a card from your hand and making a match as is appropriate, flip over the top card from the deck and play it to the field in the same manner as above, again making a match by suit if possible. Once you have played a card both from your hand and the deck, collect any cards captured into your scoring area. It is a good idea to keep your scoring area categorized by card type.
## Checking for Yaku
At this point, evaluate your scoring area to see if you have formed any yaku. If not, the game proceeds to your opponent's turn, who will repeat the same steps described above. If you *have* formed a yaku or improved a yaku that you have already captured, you are given the choice whether to continue the round or not. Note that in many versions of the game, the Sake Cup (Chrysanthemum Animal) may count towards both the Animals category **and** the Chaff category for making yaku.
## Calling "Koi-Koi"
To call "koi-koi" is to choose to continue the round - a calculated risk that will either lead to increasing your score, or to you forfeiting the points you would have earned that round. If declaring "koi-koi," the game simply continues to the opponent's turn. In most rule sets, "koi-koi" may be called as many times as desired by either player.
## Calling “Shōbu”
To declare “shōbu” is to choose to end the round and earn points according to the yaku you have captured, applying any applicable multipliers. The player who calls “shōbu” is the only one who earns any points that round, and becomes the dealer for the next round.
## Draw Hand
If both players run out of cards in hand without calling “shōbu”, the round ends in a draw and neither player earns any points. Note that if you captured yaku and called "koi-koi" but did not subsequently improve your yaku and call “shōbu”, before your cards ran out, **your points are forfeit.** In the case of a draw hand, the dealer will either change or stay the same depending on the rule set used, though changing dealers at a draw may decrease the effect of dealer privelege.
## Score Multipliers
Depending on the preferred rule set, there are two commonly applied score multipliers that may take effect. Some people play with no multipliers, while others may even utilize more than are described here.
### Over 7 Points
If the combined value of your captured yaku is greater than 7, the score you earn upon calling “shōbu” will be doubled. This multiplier should be applied before the following one, in the case that both apply.
### Opponent Koi-Koi
If your opponent calls "koi-koi" but you manage to declare “shōbu” before them, the score you earn for your captured yaku will be doubled. In some rule sets, if "koi-koi" was declared twice, the score is tripled, while in other sets, it remains only doubled.
## End of Game
Depending on the terms agreed upon during setup, the game ends after a certain number of rounds, or once a target score has been reached. If playing a certain number of rounds, the player with the greater score at the end of the last round is declared the winner. If playing to a target point total, the first to reach that score is the winner.
# Common Yaku
There are many variations of yaku [役, やく] in Koi-Koi.  Some may be house-rules while others are popular throughout.  In many cases, the point values of these yaku will change depending on the provided rules.

Yaku listed below are sorted into groups.  For each of these groups (except “Ungrouped”), only one point value is valid for a set.  For example, if you have all five Bright cards, you get the points for “Five Brights”.  You do not get the points for “Five Brights and Four Brights and Rainy Four Brights." This goes for each grouping. You receive the highest points you're allowed based on the cards captured.
