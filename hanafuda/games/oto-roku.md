**Otoroku** (おとろく) is a [Kingo](/en/hanafuda/games/kingo) variant once popular in the Tokai region of Japan.

The game was intended for 5 to 6 players, although it is possible for 2 to 7 players to play the game. 

The name comes from the fact that the last player is allowed to reach a score of 16 points instead of 15.

It was also originally designed to be played with a 4-suited [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda) deck, and was only later adapted into hanafuda.

# Equipment
**40** cards of a standard Hanafuda deck is used. Remove all **November** ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x) and **December** ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) cards.

A standard **40-card Kabufuda deck** may also be used.

If western playing cards are used, remove all Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Jokers.

In addition to the cards, **Go Stones** are used to keep track of the players' scores.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing the dealer - 親 [おや, oya] and determining the seating position, shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

A decision must be made as to how long the game will last - 12 rounds is traditional, though other common options are 6 rounds, 3 rounds, or until all but one player runs out of stones.

Next, a decision must be made if all players will **play against each other**, or **against the dealer only**.

Finally, a decision must also be made as to how much points a **wager** costs per round. It may be fixed throughout the game, or changed every time a round starts (the decision of which may be done either before or after dealing the cards, usually by the dealer).

## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. 

The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer, while the 2nd earliest sits on the dealer's right, and so on. The player with the latest month sits on the dealer's left, and will have special rules in the game.

> If bettors are playing against the dealer, then all bettors must sit on the opposite side of the table against the dealer. The 2nd earliest sits to the dealer's farthest right, while the latest month sits to the dealer's farthest left.
{.is-info}

If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.

## Dealing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the cards and deals one card to each player's hand, starting from the player to the dealer's right up to the dealer himself/herself. The rest of the cards are put face-down on the table as the draw pile.

{.is-success}

## Placing the Wager
Each player then places a wager into the table to form the **pot**, which will be received by the winner of the round.

> If bettors are all playing against the dealer, then only the bettors must place wagers on the table. Each wager must be segregated for each player.
{.is-info}

# Gameplay
Each round, the player to the dealer's right is the first to play. Turn to play goes counter-clockwise.

During a player's turn, he/she **draws a card** from the draw pile and put it in his/hand to increase the value of their hand.

Afterward, the player can **keep drawing cards** until his/her hand value total **becomes close to 15**, or **pass the turn**  to the next player if he/she thinks the next draw will push his/her hand's value beyond 15.

A player may only have 5 cards in their hand. Once a player's hand reaches 5 cards, they must pass the turn to the next player.

## Last Player's Advantage
Unlike other players whose hand value total must not exceed 15 points, the player to the dealer's left **may reach 16 points, which is considered a stronger hand than 15.**

## Buta
If the player's hand value **reaches 16 or higher (17 or higher for the player to the dealer's left)**, his/her hand is called **Buta** (ブタ, "zero"). 

The player **automatically loses the round** and must **reveal their hand and pass the turn to the next player immediately.**

> If all players have Bareta, then the round is voided, all wagers go back to the players, and the cards must be redealt by the same dealer.
{.is-info}

# Showdown
The round ends once all players have passed their turn. All players who didn't have a *buta* hand then reveal their hands for the showdown.

> The yaku in the rules suggest that it is a banking game where bettors play against the dealer, as opposed to a showdown game where all players play against each other. However, the payout is not explained in the rules. For sake of completeness, both methods will be explained below.
{.is-warning}

## Method 1. Players versus Everyone
**The player with the highest hand value wins the round, takes the pot, and becomes the dealer for the next round.**

> If two or more players have the highest hand value, then they split the pot equally. If the pot cannot be split equally, the player nearest to the dealer's right takes the largest share. In both cases, the player nearest to the dealer's right becomes the dealer for the next round.
{.is-info}

## Method 2. Dealer versus Bettors
- If the bettor has a **higher value than the dealer**, the **bettor wins** an amount equal to their wager. (*This may be reduced by the rental fee (tera-zen) to the gambling parlor*)
- If the bettor has a **lower value than the dealer**, the **dealer wins** and takes the player's wager.
- If both dealer and bettor have **equal hands worth 15 points**, then it is considered a **tie**. The bettor takes back their wager.
- If both dealer and bettor have **equal hands worth less than 15**, then the **dealer wins**.

In any case, **the dealer retains their dealer status.**

Other than the point values, there are also Teyaku which are usually strong hands. Note that some Teyaku can only be availed by the Dealer, Non-dealer, or the player to the dealer's left.
