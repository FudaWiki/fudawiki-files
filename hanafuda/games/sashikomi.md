**Sashikomi** [指込 - さしこみ] is a 2-player gambling [game](/en/hanafuda/games) played using [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). It belongs to the *kabu* genre of showdown games, whose goal is to make a hand whose sum ends in "9".. It is mostly luck-based, but includes a discard-and-draw choice reminiscent of that used in Draw Poker that gives it some strategy.
# Setup
First, the two players agree upon the amount of money to wager and each put up an identical amount.

The dealer thoroughly shuffles the deck and sets it on the table.
# Gameplay
The dealer takes the first **3 cards** from the top of the deck - this becomes their hand. The other player then takes the next **3 cards** to be their own hand.

Next, the dealer evaluates their hand and decides whether to **discard (only) one of their cards and draw a new one**. They may do this only once. Then the dealer's opponent is offered the same choice, with the same restrictions of only one card, one time.

Finally is the showdown: Both players reveal their hands. **The value of the hand is decided by the ones' digit of the sum of their cards' numeric values according to the [standard suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits). The player whose hand value is the highest (i.e. the closest to 9) wins the round, and earns all money wagered.**
