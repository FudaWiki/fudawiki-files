**Sashikomi** [指込 - さしこみ] is a 2-player gambling [game](/en/hanafuda/games) played using [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). It belongs to the *kabu* genre of showdown games, whose goal is to make a hand whose sum ends in "9". It is mostly luck-based, but includes a discard-and-draw choice reminiscent of that used in Draw Poker that gives it some strategy.
# Setup
First, the two players agree upon the amount of money to wager and each put up an identical amount.

Players select the dealer for the round in whatever method is agreeable to both parties. 

The dealer thoroughly shuffles a standard 48-card deck and sets it on the table.
# Gameplay
The dealer takes the first **3 cards** from the top of the deck - this becomes their hand. The other player then takes the next **3 cards** to be their own hand. Players' hands are kept private from the other player.

Next, the dealer evaluates their hand and decides whether to **discard (only) one of their cards and draw a new one**. They may do this only once. Then the dealer's opponent is offered the same choice, with the same restrictions of only one card, one time.

Finally is the showdown: Both players reveal their hands. **The value of the hand is decided by the ones' digit of the sum of their cards' numeric values according to the [standard suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits). The player whose hand value is the highest (i.e. the closest to 9) wins the round, and earns all money wagered.**
## Example Round
The two players agree to play for $5. **Player A** is arbitrarily selected to be dealer. **Player A** shuffles the cards and then deals 3 cards to themself and 3 cards to **Player B**.

**Player A** received a hand consisting of [![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria) (=4), [![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)Iris](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris) (=5), and [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) (=12). `4+5+12=21`. The last digit of `21` is `1`, so **this hand's value is 1**. (This is a very poor hand.)

**Player B**'s dealt hand consisted of 2 [![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Bush Clovers](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover) (=7x2) and 1 [![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria) (=4). `7x2+4=18`. The last digit of `18` is `8`, so **this hand's value is 8.** (This is a rather good hand.)

**Player A**, being the dealer, takes the first turn deciding whether to trade a card. They **discard** the [![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria) and **draw a new card** from the deck: a [![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Susuki Grass](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass) (=8). Their new hand is ![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x): `5+8+12=25`, which ends in `5`, so **Player A's final hand value is 5.**

**Player B** then has the option to discard one card and draw one new one; however, **Player B** is content with their hand and **chooses not to exchange a card.** Thus **Player B's hand remains at a value of 8.**

Lastly, the players reveal their hands to one another and compare their values. Ultimately, **Player B** had the better hand, and so wins the round. **Player A** pays player B $5.
