San-Zoku Go-Jū [三束五十 - さんぞくごじゅう, lit. “Three Bunches and Fifty”] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for three players, with simple rules. 

The name *San-Zoku Go-Jū* refers to the par score of the game: 350 points. *(In this context, a "bunch" is 100 points.)*

There were no Teyaku nor Dekiyaku attested for this game, so it is assumed to be a Bakappana variant.

# Card Values
> The card values used in San-Zoku Go-Jū are non-standard.
{.is-warning}

|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|100|5|
|Animal|50|9|
|Ribbon|10|10|
|Chaff|0|24|

Since the total card points in a deck is 1050, when divided by 3, you will get the **par score** which is **350 points**.

# Gameplay
The setup and gameplay are the same as Bakappana; In each round, players play until their hands run out of cards.


# Scoring
Players count their captured card points, they subtract the **par score** of **350 points** to get the settlement score, and they do the settlement accordingly (negative score means you lose points; positive score means you gain points).

`Settlement Score = Total of captured card points - 350`

The winner in a round becomes the dealer for the next round.
