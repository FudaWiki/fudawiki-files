**Seotda** [섰다 or 섯다, lit. 'stood up'] is a Korean Hanafuda game for 2-10 players in which players bet on the value of their dealt cards across multiple rounds, similar to most poker games.

The name comes from the word shouted to indicate the start of betting.

The game seems to be closely related to the game [Kachi-Kachi](/en/kabufuda/games/kachi-kachi), but shares the same method of gameplay as Poker, even down to borrowing the same terminologies during betting. Also, like Poker, Seotda has many different gameplay variations, but the most basic version (the one described below) is called **2-card Seotda**.

There also seems to be a local variant of Seotda played in Jeju Island.

# Equipment
**Seotda** is played using **20 cards** of a *Hanafuda* deck, consisting of only the two most valuable types of the cards from January to October.

> **You must be familiar with the [month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) of the cards to play the game.**
{.is-warning}

> It is also attested to be played in Jeju Island using 40 cards, by only removing the Willow ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x) and Paulownia ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) cards from the deck. For the purposes of these rules, only 20 cards will be used in the game.
{.is-warning}

Additionally, **chips** or other small counters are used to keep track of bets and players' scores.

# Gameplay
For the initial hand, determine the dealer using a method of your choice. For subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand will deal the following hand. In the event of a draw, the dealer of the drawn hand will deal the following hand.

Before the game starts, determine the **pping** [삥], which is the *minimum bet size* a player can make.

The dealer then deals each player two cards.
## Betting Round
Betting turns start from the dealer and moves counter-clockwise.

During a player's betting turn, they may choose one of the following actions:
|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|**Minimum**</br>(삥, *pping*)|Place the minimum bet amount in the pot.</br>*This can only be done if nobody has bet during that betting round previously.*|
|**Call**</br>(콜, *kol*)|Place the same amount as the previous bet.|
|**Double**</br>(따당, *ttadang*)|Raise the bet to double the amount as the previous bet.|
|**Full**</br>(풀, *pul*)|Raise the bet to the full amount of the pot.</br>*The amount must be higher than the previous bet.*|
|**Half**</br>(하프, *hapeu*)|Raise the bet to half the amount of the pot.</br>*The amount must be higher than the previous bet.*|
|**Quarter**</br>(쿼터, *kweoteo*)|Raise the bet to one-fourth the amount of the pot.</br>*The amount must be higher than the previous bet.*|
|**Check**</br>(체크, *chekeu*)|Wait until the end of the betting round before making a decision.</br>*After the betting round goes back to your turn, you can only either make a bet or fold (Die).*|
|**Die**</br>(다이, *dai*)|Fold; Forfeit the round and lose all the amount you have bet during that round.|

The betting round ends if all players who have not folded have same amount of bets. 

> Some players play such that the betting round loops for only a limited number of times. House rules prevail.
{.is-warning}

Players who have not folded then proceed to *showdown*.

>If all players except one fold, the last remaining player collects the pot without proceeding to *showdown*.

## Showdown
Starting with the dealer (or closest player in order), each player reveals their cards. Hands are evaluated according to the *Hand Rankings* chart below. The winner of the hand collects the pot and becomes the dealer for the next hand.

> In case of a tie, the pot is kept intact. The players involved in the tie must play a hand between them as a tie-breaker, and the winner of the hand takes the pot.
