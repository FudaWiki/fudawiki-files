**Seotda** [섰다 or 섯다, lit. 'stood up'] is a Korean Hanafuda game for 2-20 players in which players bet on the value of their dealt cards across multiple rounds, similar to other showdown games like Poker. The name comes from the word shouted to indicate the start of betting.


Initially played with [Tujeon](https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/1630), nowadays the game uses Hwatu or Hanafuda instead and adopted some terminology and rules from [Oicho-Kabu](/en/kabufuda/games/oicho-kabu). Also, like Poker, Seotda has many different gameplay variations, but the most basic version (the one described below) is called **2-card Seotda**.

A very similar game played using Kabufuda exists in Japan, called [Kachi-kachi](/en/kabufuda/games/kachi-kachi).

# Equipment
**Seotda** is played using **20 cards** of a *Hanafuda* deck, consisting of only the two most valuable types of the cards from January to October.

> **You must be familiar with the [month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) of the cards to play the game.**
{.is-warning}

> The game can also be played using **40 cards** from January to October including Chaff cards.
{.is-info}


Additionally, **chips** or other small counters are used to keep track of bets and players' scores.

# Gameplay
For the initial hand, determine the dealer using a method of your choice. For subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand will deal the following hand. In the event of a draw, the dealer of the drawn hand will deal the following hand.

The dealer then deals each player two cards.

## Betting Round
Betting turns start from the dealer and moves counter-clockwise.

Betting rules greatly vary among regions and platforms. In real-life the betting rules are similar to Poker's, but Korean online sites adopted [betting rules of their own Poker implementations](https://fudawiki.org/e/en/koreanonlinebetting).

After all betting rounds, players who have not folded proceed to *showdown*. If all players except one fold, the last remaining player collects the pot without proceeding to *showdown*.

## Showdown
Starting with the dealer (or closest player in order), each player reveals their cards. Hands are evaluated according to the *Hand Rankings* chart below. The winner of the hand collects the pot and becomes the dealer for the next hand.

In case of a tie, the pot is kept intact. The players involved in the tie must play a hand between them as a tie-breaker, and the winner of the hand takes the pot.

> Tiebreaker round consist of only a single betting round.
Also, in 3-card variants minimum number of cards is dealt during a tiebreaker.
For example, the dealer deals each player two cards in regular 3-card variant. In 3-card variant with a community card, the dealer deals each player a card and then deals a community card.

# Other Variants
## Dealing Variants
Seotda's base rules are 2-card straight.

However, the game can be played with variations like 2-card draw, 3-card straight (삼봉 섰다 - *Sambong Seotda*), 3-card stud (3-card Seotda serviced on Korean online platforms), 3-card draw (Hangame services this variant as 섯둑이 - *Seot-dugi*), 3-card community (2 cards in hand and a community card, Hangame services this variant as 홀덤 섯다 - Hold'em *Seotda*) and etc.

In 3-card Seotda variants, all surviving players must select 2 cards to use (thus choosing their hand rank) just before showdown.

## 3-card combinations
In this 3-card Seotda variant a set of 3 cards may form a hand instead of 2 cards among them, which trumps all regular hands.

# Dorijitgo-ttaeng

**Dorijitgo-ttaeng** [도리짓고 땡] is a Korean Hanafuda showdown game for 2-8 players which shares the same hand ranking list as Seotda. This game also originates in [Tujeon](https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/1630) and then changed cards used into Hwatu or Hanafuda later.

## Hand

A hand of Dorijitgo-ttaeng consists of 5 cards. Players must form a combination of 3 cards whose value total is divisible by 10 (10, 20, 30) and use two remaining cards to determine the hand rank, similar to [Gomai-kabu](/en/kabufuda/games/gomai-kabu).

If a player fails to create a 3-card combination, the player **busts** (황, *hwang*) and loses regardless of other two cards unless all the other players bust (and score a tie) or fold (in this case the surviving player wins as the normal rules).

## Double Pair

In Dorijitgo-ttaeng, a single hand may compose multiple hand rank combinations.
For example, ![](/sheldonchen-cards/10.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/50.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/51.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/91.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/100.svg#hanafuda-card =50x) may be considered as a **1 and 9** (5-5-0 / 1-9) or a **Pair of 5** (1-9-0 / 5-5).

In **Double Pair** variant (춘추땡, *chunchu-ttaeng*), a hand which results in 2 **different** pairs trumps all regular hands. If two or more players have a Double Pair, compare the higher Pairs. If still tied, compare the lower Pairs.
![](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/21.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/61.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/70.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/71.svg#hanafuda-card =50x) is a **Double Pair of 7 and 2**.
![](/sheldonchen-cards/10.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/21.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/30.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)![](/sheldonchen-cards/60.svg#hanafuda-card =50x) is a **Double Pair of Bright and 2** (only when Bright Pairs are allowed)

## Dealing variants

Like Seotda, Dorijitgo-ttaeng can be played with variations, albeit much like Poker such as 5-card draw, 7-card stud or Hold'em since the hand consists of 5 cards just like Poker. Common rules use 5-card straight.
