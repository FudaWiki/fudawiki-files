Sanuki Mekuri [讃岐メクリ - さぬきめくり] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for two players, with simple rules but unique card points.

The name may refer to the Sanuki province of Japan, where the game may have originated. The game may have also been originally played using a Mekuri Karuta deck instead of Hanafuda, as some of the card points are identical to their month numbers.

The goal of the game is to **gain 40 points more than your opponent**.

The game may or may not have a limited number of rounds, and it is assumed that if all rounds have ended without a player reaching the difference of 40 points, the player with the highest score wins.

# Card Values
The card values are unique in that they are based on their month number, as well as their card type.

For the purposes of these rules, the following are considered:
- There is no distinction between Brights and Animals, so they are all called **Animals**.
- Animals that are worth their ***month value*** are called **Special Animals**. 
They are the Butterflies, the Boar, the Full Moon, and the Sake Cup.
- Animals that are worth ***5 points*** each are called **Normal Animals**. 
They are the Crane, the Bush Warbler, the Curtain, the Cuckoo, the Bridge, the Deer, the Rainman, and the Phoenix.
- **Ribbons** are worth ***1 point each***. 
The Geese and the Yellow Paulownia Chaff also belong to this Category.
- **Chaff** are worth ***0 points***. 
The Swallow also belongs to this category.

> Note that the Bridge card is also worth it's month value: 5 points. However, since all Normal Animals are worth 5 points, the Bridge card is considered a Normal Animal card.

> Since the scoring is cumulative, the par score is not used in this game.

# Gameplay
The setup and gameplay are the same as Bakappana; In each round, players play until their hands run out of cards.


# Scoring
Scoring in this game is **cumulative**.

After each round, players count their captured card points, then they check each player's total score in the game.

The difference between the players' total scores are checked. **If the difference reaches 40 points or higher, the game ends, and the player with the higher score wins the game.**

If the difference is less than 40 points, another round is played. The player with more points obtained in a round becomes the dealer for the next round.
