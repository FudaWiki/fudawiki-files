**Tokotoko** is a quick gambling game played with the 6 "dead cards" set aside during the deal in [Tensho](/en/hanafuda/games/tensho). In this form, it is a game for 2 players, though it is easily modified to include more. It bears a slight resemblance to Texas Hold'em, but with the goal of making a *kabu* hand rather than one of poker's many hands.
