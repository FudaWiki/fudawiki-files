**Tokotoko** (written in Japanese as トコトコ or 床々) is a quick gambling game played with the 6 "dead cards" set aside during the deal in [Tensho](/en/hanafuda/games/tensho). In this form, it is a game for **2 players**, though it is easily modified to include more. It bears a slight resemblance to Texas Hold'em, but with the goal of making the **best 3-card *kabu* hand** rather than one of poker's many 5-card combinations.

# Setup
First, prepare the deck as you would for Tensho or [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana) by removing the 3 Chaff of [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia), leaving a deck of 45 cards. 

If playing Tokotoko as a **side-game to Tensho, the 6 "dead cards" set aside during the deal will be used for a 2-player game of Tokotoko** at the conclusion of the round. If more than 2 players wish to participate, **2 additional cards per additional player** are taken from the captured cards of the victor of Tensho and **shuffled together with these "dead cards".**

Then, **2 cards are dealt to each player**, and the **remaining 2 cards are kept face-down** on the table.
# Gameplay
Once all players have looked at their hands, players come to an agreement as to how much money to bet; **all players must put up the same amount before the game can progress.**

Once all players have put up the appropriate amount of money, the **2 field cards are flipped face-up** for all to see. These cards are communal and are able to be used by any and all players.

Then, **each player in turn chooses any 3 of the 4 cards available to them to create a *kabu* hand**; this may consist of both hand cards and one field card, or both field cards and one hand card.

**The winner is the player whose selected 3-card hand has the highest value in the ones digit when the 3 card values are summed.** That player earns all the money that was wagered. In the case of a tie, the pot may be split evenly among the winners.

Note that the card values follow the [Nagoya suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) used in such games as [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko) and [Isuri](/en/hanafuda/games/isuri). For instance, [![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine) cards have a value of 1, while the [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) counts as a 6.
