**Botan-chō** [牡丹蝶 - ぼたんちょう] is a [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi) variant for 2 players, played in the Kanto region in Japan.

The gameplay and Yaku list are identical to Mushi, but with the addition of the ![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)**Peony with Butterflies** card, which is used as a wild card [鬼札 - おにふだ, *onifuda*] instead of the ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning card. This card is where the game got its name from.

[![Peony with Butterflies](/sheldonchen-cards/60.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony#butterflies)

## Setup
**41 cards** of a standard hanafuda deck are used. Remove all ![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)Peony and ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Bush Clover cards from the deck, **except the Peony with Butterflies card**.

**Score counters** such as chips, go stones, or matchsticks, would be helpful in keeping track of players' scores.

Before playing the game, players must decide first how many rounds they should play, and **prepare 1-point counters equal to the number of rounds in the game**. They will be used as round counters during the game. In addition, a 1-point bonus would be given to a player every time they won a round.

## Distributing the Initial Cards
**Nine cards are distributed to each player, and five to the table.** While there is no required method for this distribution, it is common for the dealer to give three to the table, three to their opponent, and three to themself, then two to the table, three to their opponent, and three to themself, and then three again to their opponent, and finally three to themself.

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

>If 4 cards of the same suit are dealt to the field at the beginning of a round, a **misdeal** is declared and the same dealer shuffles and distributes cards once more.

## Botan-chō card Rule
The Peony with Butterflies card can be matched with any one card, regardless of its suit.

At the end of the round, the remaining card on the field belongs to the player who used the Peony with Butterflies card.

## Scoring
At the end of the round, players score both for the value of their captured cards, and for any *yaku* (scoring combinations) they managed to collect in their score piles.

The values of each card in Mushi are the standard ones used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) and many other games, though the reduction in suits leads to different distributions of those card types.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|8|
|Ribbon|5|8|
|Chaff|1|20|

>Note that the Peony with Butterflies card is treated as an Animal card worth 10 points during counting of captured card points.
{.is-info}

This means that the total value of the entire deck is 240. Since **each player could conceivably capture exactly 120 points**, only the points in excess of that are counted. Hence, to calculate one's initial score for a given round, add up the points for all cards captured, and subtract 120.

Then, the players check for any yaku they formed. The total value of a player's yaku is **paid to them by their opponent**, in a zero-sum fashion. For example, if a player has 40 points' worth of yaku, then they gain 40 points, while their opponent *loses* 40 points.

In summary, the total amount of points won or lost by the players at the end of each round is

`Player's Score = (Player's Total Card Points - 120) + Total Value of Player's Yaku - Total Value of Opponent's Yaku`.

**The player with the positive score is considered the winner of a round**, and the other player must pay the winner points equal to their score. In addition, the winner also **takes one round counter as a bonus, which is worth 1 point.**

When the last round counter is taken (i.e. the final round is played), the game ends, and the player with the most points is declared the winner of the game.
