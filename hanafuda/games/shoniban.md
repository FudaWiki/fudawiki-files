Batta Maki [バッタまき] is a gambling game in which a group of players bet between two groups of cards, and the higher scoring group wins.

It was one of the most common forms of gambling in the Kanto region of Japan, and is known as Honbiki [ホンビキ] in the west, and Atosaki [アトサキ] in the east.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, oya], deciding the seating arrangement of the other players, and shuffling the deck. Certain ground rules should also be agreed upon before play begins.

# Equipment
A standard 48-card hanafuda deck is used, with each month representing the numbers 1 to 12. The [standard month arrangement](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) is used in this game.

>**This game requires familiarity with the sequence of the months.**

In addition to the deck, a collection of chips to represent points will be highly useful. Using different colours of chips for each player will help with tracking bets.

## Choosing the Dealer and Seating
To begin, each player draws a card from the deck. The player with the earliest month becomes the dealer, and the remaining players seat themselves on the other side of the table in order anti-clockwise around the table- the second-earliest month sits nearest to the right side of the dealer, third-earliest to the right of them, and so on.

If the dealer represents an establishment- say, when playing at a casino or gambling parlour- then their role will obviously be fixed, though the other players may still use this process to determine their seating order.

In the event of a tie, the players in question should draw a second card and compare again.

# Gameplay
The dealer shuffles the deck, draws 3 cards from the top of the deck and places them in a stack face down near him/her. This first batch of 3 cards is called **"Saki"**.

Next, the dealer draws 3 more cards from the top of the deck and places them in a stack face down near the players. This 2nd batch of 3 cards is called **"Ato"**.

The dealer then arranges each stack into rows of 3 face-down cards, starting with the "Saki".

Afterward, the betting begins.

# Betting
Each player, starting from the player nearest to the dealer's right, chooses whether to place their wager on "Ato" or "Saki".

> Any limits regarding the players' wagers has not been attested. House rules prevail.
{.is-warning}

If the total wagers placed on "Ato" and on "Saki" are not equal, then the dealer places an amount on the batch with the lower wagers to make them equal. *(Of course, the dealer's wager will always return to the dealer after the showdown.)*

However, it is the skill of the dealer to entice the players to place wagers such that the two batches' wagers become as close to being equal as possible.

# Showdown
Once all betting has been done, the dealer then exposes all cards from the two batches.

The score of each batch is determined by adding the total month points of all 3 cards of the batch. Totals that go over 9 'wrap around' by discarding the tens digit. So 10 is equivalent to 0, 11 is equivalent to 1, and so on, much like Baccarat.

The batch with a higher score is considered the winning batch.

- Players who bet on the winning batch wins 90% of the amount of the wager they placed. (The remaining 10% is considered as "rental fee" [寺銭 - てらぜん, *terazen*] for the gambling parlor)
- Players who bet on the other batch loses their wager; it is taken by the dealer.

# Additional Rounds
No particular setup is given for playing additional rounds. When playing at a casino or parlour, the dealer will remain the dealer, though the players may cycle their seating positions.

In casual games, the dealer may either remain fixed, or lose their role if the batch he/she placed a wager onto loses during the showdown. In this case, the player to their right becomes the next dealer.
