Batta Maki [バッタまき] is a gambling game in which a group of players bet between two groups of cards, and the higher scoring group wins.

It was one of the most common forms of gambling in the Kanto region of Japan, and is known as Honbiki [ホンビキ] in the west, and Atosaki [アトサキ] in the east.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, oya], deciding the seating arrangement of the other players, and shuffling the deck. Certain ground rules should also be agreed upon before play begins.

# Equipment
A standard **48-card hanafuda deck** is used, with each month representing the numbers 1 to 12. The [standard month arrangement](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) is used in this game.

>**This game requires familiarity with the sequence of the months.**

In addition to the deck, a collection of **chips** to represent points will be highly useful, assuming the game is played casually and not for actual gambling. 

> Using different colours of chips for each player will help with tracking bets.

## Choosing the Dealer and Seating
If the dealer represents an establishment- say, when playing at a casino or gambling parlour- then their role will obviously be fixed. If played only casually, then the dealer may be decided as follows.

To begin, each player draws a card from the deck. The player with the earliest month becomes the dealer, and the remaining players seat themselves on the other side of the table facing the dealer.

In the event of a tie, the players in question may either draw a second card and compare again, or use the card types to determine which one is more valuable.

# Gameplay
The dealer shuffles the deck, draws 3 cards from the top of the deck and places them in a stack face down near him/her. This first batch of 3 cards is called **"Saki"**.

Next, the dealer draws 3 more cards from the top of the deck and places them in a stack face down near the players. This 2nd batch of 3 cards is called **"Ato"**.

The dealer then arranges each stack into rows of 3 face-down cards, starting with the "Saki".

Afterward, the dealer calls out "Ato or Saki? Choose one only!", and the betting begins.

# Betting
Players then choose whether to place their wager on "Ato" or "Saki".

> Any limits regarding the amount in the players' wagers has not been attested. House rules prevail.
{.is-warning}

If the total wagers placed on "Ato" and on "Saki" are not equal, then the dealer must entice the players to place an amount on the batch with the lower wager to equalize them.

> It is the skill of the dealer as a representative of the gambling parlor to entice the players to place wagers such that the two batches' wagers become as close to being equal as possible.
{.is-info}

Once the players have already decided that they are done placing wagers, then the dealer places his/her own wager on the batch with the lower wager to make them exactly equal.

# Showdown
Once all betting has been done, the dealer then exposes all cards from the two batches.

The score of each batch is determined by adding the total month points of all 3 cards of the batch. Totals that go over 9 'wrap around' by discarding the tens digit. So 10 is equivalent to 0, 11 is equivalent to 1, and so on, much like Baccarat.

The batch with a higher score is considered the winning batch.

- Players who bet on the winning batch wins 100% of the amount of the wager they placed. 

>If playing for money, then only 90% of the amount of the wager is won. (The remaining 10% is considered as "rental fee" [寺銭 - てらぜん, *terazen*] for the gambling parlor).
{.is-info}

- Players who bet on the other batch loses their wager; it is taken by the dealer.
- The dealer's bet goes back to the dealer, whether it is placed on the winning batch or not.

# Additional Rounds
No particular setup is given for playing additional rounds. Players can keep playing for as many rounds as they want.
