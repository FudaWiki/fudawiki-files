Sakura is a popular hanafuda game in Hawaii for 2-7 players (though said to be best for 2-4). It is also known as Higo-Bana, Hawaiian Koi-Koi, or even just Hanafuda. It uses unique point values for the cards, with Ribbons and Animals switching their usual points with the other. It also features unique Hiki rules and uses the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) as a wild card.
# Setup
First, determine how many are to play and who will make up each team. For 2, 3, 5, or 7 players, each participant plays on their own. For a 4-player game, each team will consist of 2 players. For a 6-player game, the teams may consist of 2 or 3 players apiece. If playing in teams of 2, teammates should sit opposite one another; for teams of 3, players from each team should be seated alternately around the table.

It is also a good idea to establish house rules and come to an agreement over scoring and how long the game shall last at this point in time.

Next, determine who will be the first dealer. Any method may be used, but a traditional mode would be to have each player draw one card from the deck, and whoever draws the earliest month in the standard [order of suits](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) deals first. (In the case of a tie, the tied players may draw again until the matter is resolved.)

## The Deal
Once the cards have been shuffled and cut, the dealer passes out cards face down to each player and face up to the field according to the following chart.

|Number of Players|Cards to each Player|Cards to the Field|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|2|8|8|
|3|7|6|
|4|5|8|
|5|4|8|
|6|3|12|
|7|3|6|

Any remaining cards form the draw pile for the round and are to be placed in a single face down stack beside the field cards.

If four cards of the same suit have been dealt to the table, the dealer automatically captures them.
# Gameplay
As in most Hanafuda games, the dealer takes the first turn, followed by each player around the table in counter-clockwise order.
## Turns
On your turn, choose one card from your hand to play to the field. If it matches suits with one card on the field, overlap the two, indicating that you will capture those cards. If it matches suits with two cards on the field, choose one of those two to capture with your card. If your played card matches 3 cards on the field, all 4 will be captured. If your played card does not have any matches on the field, it will simply become a field card.

After playing a card from your hand and making a match as is appropriate, flip over the top card from the deck and play it to the field in the same manner as above, again making a match by suit if possible. Once you have played a card both from your hand and the deck, collect any cards captured into your scoring area.

Scoring areas should be kept organized by point value, with each card visible. Unlike in other games though, captured Chaff cards are simply discarded into one central pile rather than arranged in the scoring area. (This does not affect scoring since Chaff are not worth any points on their own and do not have any role in yaku.)

# Card Values
Note that in this game, the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) is treated as an Animal rather than a Bright. Note as well the reversal from the usual values for Animals and Ribbons, and that the [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff) has the value of a Ribbon.

Thus, a complete deck contains 240 points.
# Yaku
There are 8 yaku in Sakura, each consisting of 3 cards. Each is worth 50 points, but unlike in most other fishing games, the points are subtracted from each opponent's score rather than being added to one's own.

The yaku in this game also seem to lack specific names; instead, each is typically assigned one of the first 8 syllables of the [Iroha poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha). In the Paradise Factors rule leaflet, they are instead simply numbered from 1 to 8, following the same order.

# Strategy
There are four cards that contribute to 2 yaku each; thus, these should be considered more valuable than others and priority should be given to their capture. These are the [![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain), [![monthicon_7.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Boar](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#boar), [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup), and [![monthicon_10.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_10.png =20x)Deer](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple#deer). Among these, the ![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain is worth 20 points on its own as well, making it the most valuable card in the game.

That said, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; rather than indiscriminately aiming to capture the four most versatile cards, one should try to capture cards that synergize with those in their hand or those that they have already captured whenever possible.

Being that Chaff cards are not worth any points, one should refrain from matching two Chaff together, and instead attempt to hold onto any Chaff in the hand until one of its matching point cards appear on the board. But, it is usually better to discard a Chaff or match it with another Chaff than to discard a more valuable card and risk allowing another player to claim it.

Note that the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) suit cards do not participate in any yaku.
