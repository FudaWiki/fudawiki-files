Sakura is a popular hanafuda game in Hawaii for 2-7 players. It is also known as Higo-Bana, Hawaiian Koi-Koi, or even just Hanafuda. It uses unique point values for the cards, with Ribbons and Animals switching their usual points with the other. It also features unique Hiki rules and uses the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) as a wild card.
# Setup

# Gameplay

# Card Values
Note that in this game, the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) is treated as an Animal rather than a Bright. Note as well the reversal from the usual values for Animals and Ribbons, and that the [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff) has the value of a Ribbon.

Thus, a complete deck contains 240 points.
# Yaku
There are 8 yaku in Sakura, each consisting of 3 cards. Each is worth 50 points, but unlike in most other fishing games, the points are subtracted from each opponent's score rather than being added to one's own.

The yaku in this game also seem to lack specific name; instead, each is assigned one of the first 8 syllables of the [Iroha poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha).
|Name of Yaku|Description|
|:---:|:---:|
|I - い|
|Ro - ろ|
|Ha - は|
|Ni - に|
|Ho - ほ|
|He - へ|
|To - と|
|Chi - ち|
