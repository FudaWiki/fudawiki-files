Sendai-hana [仙台花] is a [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) variant for 3 players. It is named after the city of Sendai, in the Miyagi prefecture in Japan, where it is attested to be played.

**Just like in Koi-koi, card points are not counted in this game. Points are obtained only by forming Yaku.**

## Distributing the Initial Cards

**Seven (7)** cards are distributed to each player, and **six (6)** to the table, and the remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

> If four cards of the same month are dealt on the **field**, then a **misdeal** is declared, and the dealer reshuffles and deals again.
{.is-info}

## Checking for Teyaku
After the cards are dealt, each player checks if they possess any sets in hand called *teyaku* [手役 - てやく].

|Value (in points)|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|<h2 align="left">Group A: Set Teyaku</h2>|||
|150|**Three Pairs**<br/>喰付 [くっつき, *kuttsuki*] (lit. *sticky?*)|Three pairs of cards- a pair being two cards from the same month.|
|150|**Triplet and Two Pairs**<br/>跳剣 [はねけん, *haneken*] (lit. *jumping sword?*)|A Triplet (or Standing Triplet) and two pairs.|
|150|**Four-Three**<br/>四三 [しそう, *shisou*]|Four of a kind and a Triplet (or Standing Triplet).|
|50|**Four of a Kind**<br/>手四 [てし, *teshi*]|Four cards from the same month.</br>*Only ![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)Wisteria, ![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)Iris, ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Bush Clover, ![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Susuki Grass, and ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia are counted.*|

## Exposing the Teyaku
A player who has a Teyaku may choose to expose it.

> What happens after exposing a Teyaku is not explained; Decide first whether to stop the round and claim the points, or to claim the points and continue playing before starting the game. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**
{.is-warning}


## Gameplay (Koi-koi mechanics)
The gameplay is similar to Koi-koi in that as soon as a Dekiyaku is formed, the player who has formed the Dekiyaku has a choice whether to **"stop"** the round and claim the points, or continue the round (**"go"**) in hopes of forming another Dekiyaku.

Also, if a player continued the round, and the opponent then formed a dekiyaku and stopped the round, then the player's Dekiyaku is forfeited.

## Dekiyaku
All Dekiyaku **stack** except for Dekiyaku in the Bright Yaku group (only the highest scoring Bright Yaku is counted).
