Enshu-bana (遠州花, lit. “Enshu Flowers”) is a [Hana-Awase](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for two to three players, played in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan. Locally, it is known as Shishibochushin (ししぼちゅしん).

The game features **3 teyaku and 8 dekiyaku**. At every round, players place a wager into the pot, and dealer deals the cards. Players then check for teyaku in their hand. Afterward, the gameplay is the same as Hana-awase, and **play continues until all players' hands run out of cards**. 

Players then count their card points, plus the value of dekiyaku formed, plus 50 points if the Triplet teyaku is formed during the round. **The** **player with the highest score wins the round** and takes the pot.

**There are some teyaku and dekiyaku that stop the round.** If a player forms one of these yaku at any point in the game, **he/she immediately wins the round**; the round is stopped, all points scored during the round are forfeited, other players place more wagers into the pot according to the value of the yaku, and the winner then takes the pot.

# Card Values

The card values used in Enshu-bana are slightly different from those used in [Hachi-Hachi](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi). The **Rainman** is considered an **Animal** instead of a Bright, and all Chaffs are worth **0 points**.

| Card Type | Value | Number in Deck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bright | 20*  | 4   |
| Animal | 10  | 10  |
| Ribbon | 5   | 10  |
| Chaff | 0   | 24  |

*some say that Brights are worth 30 points.

# Playing for Points (Variant)
This is a more simplified version of the game, with the gambling element removed.

In this game, none of the yaku stops the round; **the round only ends when all players run out of cards**.

Players then count their card points, and if they formed a yaku, they either add the yaku's value to their score or multiply their score, depending on the yaku. **The player with the highest score wins the round.**

# Teyaku

| Value | Name of Yaku | Composition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 50 pts. | **Four-Three** (Shisou) | Four cards of the same month plus Three cards of another month. |
| 50 pts. | **Triplet** (Sanbon) | Three cards of the same month.  <br>Only Iris![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x), Chrysanthemum![Icon for month 9](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x), and Paulownia![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) cards are counted. |

Playing with Teyaku is optional; some play without Teyaku.
