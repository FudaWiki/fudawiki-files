Enshu-bana (遠州花, lit. “Enshu Flowers”) is a [Hana-Awase](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for three players, played in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan. It is a simple gambling game where each player puts a wager in advance before starting the round and the winner of the round takes all. 

The game features **3 teyaku and 8 dekiyaku**. At every round, players place a wager into the pot, and dealer deals the cards. Players then check for teyaku in their hand. Afterward, the gameplay is the same as Hana-awase, and **play continues until all players' hands run out of cards**. 

Players then count their card points, plus the value of dekiyaku formed, plus 50 points if the Triplet teyaku is formed during the round. **The** **player with the highest score wins the round** and takes the pot.

**There are some teyaku and dekiyaku that stop the round.** If a player forms one of these yaku at any point in the game, **he/she immediately wins the round**; the round is stopped, all points scored during the round are forfeited, other players place more wagers into the pot according to the value of the yaku, and the winner then takes the pot.

# Card Values

The card values used in Enshu-bana are slightly different from those used in [Hachi-Hachi](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi). The Rainman is considered an Animal instead of a Bright, and all Chaffs are worth 0 points.
