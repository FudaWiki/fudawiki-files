Enshu-bana (遠州花, lit. “Enshu Flowers”) is a [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for two to three players, played in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan. Locally, it is known as Shishibochūshin (ししぼちゅうしん).

The game features **3 teyaku and 8 dekiyaku**. At every round, players place a wager into the pot, and dealer deals the cards. Players then check for teyaku in their hand. Afterward, the gameplay is the same as Hana-awase, and **play continues until all players' hands run out of cards**. 

Players then count their card points, plus the value of dekiyaku formed, plus 50 points if the Triplet teyaku is formed during the round. **The** **player with the highest score wins the round** and takes the pot.

>Locally, **matchsticks** were typically used for tracking wagers in the game, in similar fashion to go stones in [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) or chips in western gambling games. In addition, each player has their own **matchbox**, which was used similarly to a player's scoring basket in Hachi-hachi.

## Uchikiriyaku (Round-stopping Yaku)
There are some teyaku and dekiyaku that stop the round. They are called **Uchikiriyaku (打ち切り役, "termination yaku")**. 

If a player forms one of these yaku at any point in the game, **he/she immediately wins the round**; the round is stopped, all points scored during the round are forfeited, other players place more wagers into the pot according to the value of the yaku, and the winner then takes the pot.

# Card Values

The card values used in Enshu-bana are slightly different from those used in [Hachi-Hachi](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi). The **Rainman** is considered an **Animal** instead of a Bright, and all Chaffs are worth **0 points**.

| Card Type | Value | Number in Deck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bright | 20*  | 4   |
| Animal | 10  | 10  |
| Ribbon | 5   | 10  |
| Chaff | 0   | 24  |

*some say that Brights are worth 30 points.

# Optional Rules
## Field Multiplier
After the cards have been dealt, the **number of Bright cards** on the field is counted to determine the ***field multiplier***. 

This multiplier applies to the amount of wagers paid to the winner during a specific round, and they stack with the multipliers due to forming a Dekiyaku.

- If there are **no Bright cards** on the field, the payments are **not multiplied**.
- If there is **one Bright card** on the field, the payments are **multiplied by 2**.
- If there are **two Bright cards** on the field, the payments are **multiplied by 3**.
- If there are **three Bright cards** on the field, the payments are **multiplied by 4**.
- If there are **four Bright cards** on the field, the payments are **multiplied by 5**.

The field multiplier is then confirmed by **placing a number of matchsticks on the field equal to the number of Bright cards present on the field**. (In other words, the multiplier number is equal to the number of matchsticks on the field plus 1.)

>For this purpose, you must use a **spare box of matchsticks** that do not belong to any person's score.
{.is-warning}

### *Kotsu* (Raising the Multiplier)
After the field multiplier is confirmed, each player, starting with the dealer, declares whether or not they want to increase the multiplier for the current round.

- Declare "***kotsu!***" if you want to increase the multiplier by 1. Add one matchstick from the spare box onto the field.
- Declare "***nashi!***" if you do not want to increase the multiplier.

## Enshu-bana for 4-5 players
Since a maximum of only 3 player can participate in the matching phase of the game, a "Dropout Phase" is used (under construction)

# Playing for Points (Variant)
This is a more simplified version of the game, with the gambling element removed.

In this game, none of the yaku stops the round; **the round only ends when all players run out of cards**.

Players then count their card points, and if they formed a yaku, they either add the yaku's value to their score or multiply their score, depending on the yaku. **The player with the highest score wins the round.**
