# Overview
**Go-Stop** is the most popular hanafuda game in the Korean-speaking world, most often played using plastic hanafuda known as *hwatu*. **It is named for its characteristic gameplay mechanic** that allows a player to stop the round after collecting a yaku, or to continue the round to attempt to increase their score further, at the risk of their opponent scoring in their stead. It is usually played with 2-3 players, and may involve gambling for small sums of money. **Go-stop is also known as Godori, meaning “5 birds,”** which is the name of a yaku used in this and some other games.

In many ways, Go-Stop resembles a more complex version of [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), and undoubtedly both games are related, although the precise nature of this relationship is a topic of some debate.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

A decision must be made as to how long the game will last - 12 rounds is traditional, though other common options are 6 rounds, 3 rounds, or as many rounds as it takes for one player to reach 50 points total.

> Conventionally, each round corresponds to a month of the year; the first round is January, the second February, and so on. 12 rounds is thus a *year*, 6 rounds a *half-year*, and 3 rounds a *season*.

Furthermore, the exact number of jokers in the deck, and their unique properties (if any), should be agreed upon.

Any other house rules should also be established at this point, in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

## The Deck
A Korean *hwatu* deck is structurally almost identical to a typical Japanese *hanafuda* deck. There are only two differences:

- Firstly, the suits of [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) and [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) are swapped; Paulownia is associated with November, and Willow with December.
- Secondly, *hwatu* decks come packaged with up to six additional joker cards, specifically for playing Go-Stop. The design of these jokers varies dramatically between manufacturers.

The number of jokers and the properties thereof should be agreed upon before the game begins. The presence of jokers is not important in itself - the game can just as well be played without them - but they are often included to add variety and an extra element of luck to the game.

When playing with a Japanese hanafuda deck, the blank white card included in most decks can be used as a joker if desired.
