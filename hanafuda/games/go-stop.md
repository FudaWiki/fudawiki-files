# Overview
Go-Stop is the most popular hanafuda game in the Korean-speaking world, most often played using plastic hanafuda known as hwatu. It is named for its characteristic gameplay mechanic that allows a player to stop the round after collecting a yaku, or to continue the round to attempt to increase their score further, at the risk of their opponent scoring in their stead. It is usually played with 2-3 players, and may involve gambling for small sums of money. Go-stop is also known as Godori, meaning “5 birds,” which is the name of a yaku used in this and some other games.
