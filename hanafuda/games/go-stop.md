**Go-Stop** (고스톱) is the most popular hanafuda game in the Korean-speaking world, most often played using plastic hanafuda known as *hwatu*. **It is named for its characteristic gameplay mechanic** that allows a player to stop the round after collecting a yaku, or to continue the round to attempt to increase their score further, at the risk of their opponent scoring in their stead. It is usually played with 2-3 players, and may involve gambling for small sums of money. **Go-stop is also known as Godori, meaning “5 birds,”** which is the name of a yaku used in this and some other games.

In many ways, Go-Stop resembles a more complex version of [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), and undoubtedly both games are related, although the precise nature of this relationship is a topic of some debate.

This page describes the common 2-3 player version of the game first; the variation for 4-6 players is given [further down](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop#go-stop-for-4-6-players).

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - '선' *[seon]* or 親 [おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

A decision must be made as to how long the game will last - 12 rounds is traditional, though other common options are 6 rounds, 3 rounds, or as many rounds as it takes for one player to reach 50 points total.

> Conventionally, each round corresponds to a month of the year; the first round is January, the second February, and so on. 12 rounds is thus a *year*, 6 rounds a *half-year*, and 3 rounds a *season*.
{.is-info}

Furthermore, the exact number of jokers in the deck, and their unique properties (if any), should be agreed upon, as should the required *stop minimum*.

Any other house rules should also be established at this point, in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

## The Deck
A Korean *hwatu* deck is structurally almost identical to a typical Japanese *hanafuda* deck. There are only two differences:

- Firstly, the suits of [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) and [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) are swapped; Paulownia is associated with November, and Willow with December.
- Secondly, *hwatu* decks come packaged with up to six additional joker cards, specifically for playing Go-Stop. The design of these jokers varies dramatically between manufacturers.

The number of jokers and the properties thereof should be agreed upon before the game begins. The presence of jokers is not important in itself - the game can just as well be played without them - but they are often included to add variety and an extra element of luck to the game.

When playing with a Japanese hanafuda deck, the blank white card included in most decks can be used as a joker if desired.

## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. Often in Korea, the player who drew a suit from the earliest month becomes the dealer in the night, and if both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the lower point card becomes the dealer in the night. Vice versa in the day. This practition is called [밤일낮장 - *bam-il naj-jang*] and is used in other games, such as [Minhwatu](/en/hanafuda/games/minhwatu) or [Seotda](/en/hanafuda/games/seotda). In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

> Remember that **the order of November and December is swapped** in Korean decks!
{.is-warning}

## Distributing the Initial Cards
In a two-player game, the dealer shuffles, and their opponent cuts. Then, 10 cards are dealt to each player, and 8 to the table. Typically, this is 4 to the table, 5 to the opponent, 5 to themselves, and repeat.

In a three-player game, the dealer shuffles, and the player to their left cuts. Then, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 to the field. Usually this is done as for other 3-player hanafuda games; 3 to the table, 4 to each player (starting with the player to the dealer's right and moving anti-clockwise), another 3 to the table, then 3 to each player in the same order.

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

> ![go-stop_setup.png](/hanafuda/8field10hand_setup.png =400x)<br>or<br>![6field7hand_3players_setup.png](/hanafuda/6field7hand_3players_setup.png =400x)
{.is-success}

## Checking the Hands
After the deal, players check their hands to see if they hold any four of a kind (4 cards of the same month).

> In some variations, a triplet of November or December cards may *quadruple* the score!
{.is-info}

If a player holds 4 of a kind (known as '총통' - [chongtong] in Korean or  [大統領 - だいとうりょう, *daitouryou*], which means 'president'), then they **may** reveal the hand to immediately win the round and steal the predetermined value of points from each opponent (usually 3 points which is equal to the minimum limit of Go). Revealing the hand with a 4 of a kind may be mandatory in some variants. 

In a three-player game, it is possible that two players may hold 4 of a kind. How to treat this situation varies according to the rule sets (dealer wins, the higher month wins, draw, etc.).

If *all* players hold 4 of a kind the round ends in a draw.

## Checking the Field
If any jokers are in the field at the beginning of the round, then they are immediately captured by the dealer, who then draws cards from the draw pile to replace them.

If any triplets are in the field, then they are stacked together, to indicate that all three cards will be captured together.

If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt, since these 4 cards are impossible to capture. This may be considered as the same as the dealer's a four of a kind in hand, or as a draw.

# Gameplay
In each round, the dealer is the first to play, and turn to play passes anti-clockwise around the table. While still fairly similar to other [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) fishing games, the turn structure of Go-Stop has a few additional quirks that merit being spelled out in full. Notably, matched cards are not captured immediately, but only at the end of the turn.

## Turns
A turn in Go-Stop consists of four distinct phases. Firstly, the player plays a card from their hand. Then, they play a card from the draw pile. Then, they collect their captured cards. And finally, they check for any *yaku* (scoring combinations) they may have formed.

### Phase 0
A player may reveal any number of triplets and/or jokers (and/or four of a kinds if continuing the round while holding them is allowed) before playing a card.

If a player holds a triplet, then they may choose to reveal it to the other players before playing a card. If the player manages to win the round, their score will be doubled. This is known as '흔들기' - *[heundeulgi]* (lit. 'shaking'). Should the player hold multiple triplets, they may reveal as many as they like, and the `x2` multipliers for each will stack.

If a player holds a joker, then the player may reveal and capture it immediately. They then draw a replacement card from the draw pile, and treat that card as though it were from their hand. If this completes a triplet, it can be also revealed during this phase. If the player reaches stop minimum or improves the score by capturing a joker, the player may call *go* or *stop* during Phase 4 as well.

If a player holds a four of a kind, then they may choose to reveal all four cards and double the score as the same as revealing a triplet. Also, after playing a revealed card the player may bomb the field too (accumulating 'x4' multiplier and stealing a chaff as the result, see below). 

### Phase 1

Firstly, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table, or bomb the field with a triplet in hand (see 'Bombing the Field').

- **If it belongs to the same month as another card in the field**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is stacked together to indicate that it will be captured.
- **If the played card matches with two cards in the field**, then the player may choose which one they capture during Phase 3.
- **If the played card matches a triplet (stack of three cards) in the field**, then it is stacked atop them, to indicate that all three will be captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured).
- **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the field, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player ***must*** capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

### Phase 2
After playing a card from hand, the player then takes a card from the draw pile and plays it to the table in a similar fashion.
- **If it belongs to the same month as another card in the field**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is stacked together to indicate that it will be captured.
- **If the card matches with two cards in the field**, then the player may choose which one they capture during Phase 3.
- **If the card matches a triplet (stack of three cards) in the field**, then it is stacked atop them, to indicate that all three will be captured along with the played card.
- **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the field, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.
- **If the card is a joker and a pair is not created in Phase 1**, then the player immediately captures it. They then take another card from the draw pile and play it in lieu of the joker.
- **If the card is a joker and a pair is created in Phase 1**, then the player stacks the joker on the pair. They then take another card from the draw pile and play it in lieu of the joker. If it is also a joker, it must be stacked together. If the revealed card does not form a triplet and is not a joker, the player immediately captures all revealed jokers on the pair as above.
- **If the card matches with a pair created in Phase 1 *(ignoring jokers on the stack)***, then the card is stacked atop that pair to form a triplet. This triplet is not captured by the player, and remains on the field. If the player has stacked any jokers on the pair during the same phase, the player also cannot capture stacked jokers. The player who captures this triplet will also take all jokers included. This is known as '뻑' - *[ppeok]* or '설사' - *[seolsa]* (lit. diarrhea).
- **If the card matches with a triplet created in Phase 1** (thus collecting all four cards of a month on the table), then it is stacked atop the other card to indicate its capture. No triplet is formed.

### Phase 3
After playing both their cards - one from their hand, and one from the draw pile - the player takes any captured cards into their score pile. As a rule of thumb, the captures will be stacks of either 2 or 4 cards (but *not* 3 cards, excluding jokers).

Any [*special events*](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop#special-events) should also be checked for and handled at this time.

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (Brights, Animals, Ribbons, and Chaff) to make detecting yaku easier.
{.is-warning}

### Phase 4
Finally, the player checks their score pile for '족보' - *[jokbo]*, or *yaku* [役 - やく] (scoring combinations); a list of these is given [further down](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop#yaku) the page.

- If the player has either formed a new *yaku*, or improved an existing one, then they have the choice to either end the round by calling '스톱' - *stop*, or to continue in pursuit of a higher score by calling '고' - *go*.

- If they have not, then their turn simply ends, and turn to play passes to the opponent.

Typically, a *stop minimum* is imposed; if the total value of a player's yaku is less than some agreed-upon limit, then the player cannot call *go* or *stop*. Instead, their turn simply ends, and the round continues. Typical values for the *stop minimum* are 3 points in three-player games, and 7 points in two-player games.

### Calling *Go*
If the player declares *go*, then the round continues. Their turn ends, and turn to play passes to the opponent. This is a calculated risk; continuing the round allows the opportunity to capture more yaku and earn valuable score bonuses, but forfeits all points should the opponent win first.

Note that each player may call *go* as many times as they desire during the round, with increasing bonuses for each.

### Calling *Stop*
If the player declares *stop*, then the round immediately ends, and scores are calculated. This is a safe bet, which allows the player to immediately cash in on their yaku.

## Bombing the Field
If a player holds three cards of a given month, and the fourth card is in the field, then the player may, during their turn, announce this fact and immediately capture all four cards, in a move known as '폭탄' - *[poktan]*, or *bomb*.

Bombing counts as Phase 1 of the player's turn. After playing the bomb, the player continues their turn from Phase 2.

After bombing the field, a player's hand will be two cards short (they played 3 cards on one turn). To compensate for this, *on any two subsequent turns* of the current round, the player may elect to skip Phase 1 of their turn.

## Special Events
Certain events that occur during the turn may allow the player to steal Chaff cards, or sometimes points, from their opponents. These should be checked for during [Phase 3](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop#phase-3).

### Stealing Chaff
The player receives one Chaff card from each opponent for each of the following that occur:
1. The player bombs the field in Phase 1 (see above).
2. The player captures a triplet (stack of 3). In some variants, a player capturing a triplet which was made by themselves receives two Chaff cards each instead of one (usually in 2-player games).
3. There are only two cards left in the field, both of different months, and the player captures both of them during their turn ('쓸' - *[sseul]*, lit. shortened form of 'clearing the table').
4. There are two cards in the field of the same month and the player captures both of them - one with the card from their hand, and the other with the card taken from the draw pile ('따닥' - *[ddadak]*, lit. snap).
5. The player plays a card in Phase 1 that has no match, then captures it using the card they draw in Phase 2 ('쪽' - *[jjok]*, lit. onomatopoeia of a light kiss).

The opponents may choose which Chaff card to give. If they possess no regular Chaff cards, they must surrender a 2- or 3-Chaff card (such as [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning), the [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff), or a joker). If they have no Chaff cards, they do not have to give anything.

> Items 3, 4 and 5 on this list **do not apply during the final turn** of the round.
{.is-warning}

### Stealing Points
1. If the player creates a triplet (stack of 3) on their very first turn, they steal predetermined points (usually equal to stop minimum) from each opponent ('첫뻑' - *[cheodppeok]*). If the player creates another triplet consecutively, the player receives double/quadruple of the points received on their first turn ('연뻑/삼연뻑' - *[yeonppeok/samyeonppeok]*).
2. If any player creates three triplets over the course of the round (including three consecutive triplets at the first 3 rounds, see above), then they *immediately* win the round and steal predetermined points (usually equal to stop minimum) from each opponent ('쓰리뻑' - *three [ppeok]*).
3. If the player captures all four cards from the same month on their very first turn ('첫따닥' - *[cheodddadak]*), they steal predetermined points (usually equal to stop minimum) from each opponent. If the player creates another triplet consecutively, the player receives double /quadruple of the points received on their first turn.
4. Popular variant - If a player bombs the field on their first turn ('첫폭탄' - *[choedpoktan]*) or creates a pair with two played in Phase 1 and Phase 2 ('첫쪽', *[choedjjok]*), then the player steals predetermined points from each opponent.

# End of Round and Scoring
The round ends when either a player calls *stop*, or when all players run out of cards in their hands.

If the cards run out without anyone calling *stop*, then the round is a draw. All players score nothing, **regardless of any yaku they hold**, and the next round begins with the same dealer.

Otherwise, the player who called *stop* is **the winner of the round**, and **becomes dealer for the next round**.

The winning player calculates their score as follows:

`Winner's Score = (Total Value of Winner's Yaku + Bonus Points) x Multipliers`.

This amount is then paid to the winner by their opponents, **in zero-sum fashion**. Note that only the player who called *stop* earns points; the other players **earn nothing**, even if they hold yaku.

Bonus points and extra multipliers come from a variety of sources, as listed below.

### Calling *Go*
- If the winner called *go*, they earn 1 bonus point per called *go*.
- If the winner called *go* three times, they earn a `x2` multiplier. If they called *go* four times, they earn a `x4` multiplier, and so on, with an additional `x2` multiplier for every call of *go* from the third go.

### Doubles
The winner earns a `x2` multiplier for each of the following:
- Every triplet they revealed during round.
- Capturing 7 or more Animal cards.
- Every bomb they thrown on the field.
- If the previous round had no winner (continuous draws **stack** multipliers).

## Double Penalties
There are certain situations in which an opponent must pay *double* the score as calculated above. These are:

- If the winner captured a *Bright Yaku*, then any opponent who has not captured any Bright cards must pay double.
- If the winner captured the *Chaff* generic yaku, then any opponent who has captured **1 ~ 5** (usually 1 ~ 7 in 2-player) Chaff card must pay double. The player who did not capture any Chaff card or lost all captured Chaff cards do not pay double.

## Liability & Offering a Draw
There are some situations in which a opponent is considered *liable* ('독박' - *[dokbak]*) for the winner's victory. In these situations, the liable opponent pays for *both* opponents, while the other opponent pays nothing. These are most typically used in the three-player version of the game.

1. If one of the opponents has previously called *go*, then the opponent who called *go* is liable ('고박' - *[gobak]*). If two opponents has previously called *go*, the first caller is liable. This condition trumps liability from refusing a draw offer (see below).

2. A player who have no safe play (in other words, a player cannot capture any cards by playing a card in hand and cannot reach stop minimum by flipping a card in Phase 3) may expose their hand at the start of their turn and offer a draw ('쇼당' - *[shodang]*) if they have at least 2 cards in hand and their hand entirely consists of which would allow other players to win. Each of the other players must then decide whether to accept or refuse.

This decision is made in turn order; if the player to the right accepts, then the player to the left must decide to accept or refuse. If the player to the right refuses, then the player to the left automatically accepts.

If both players accept, then the round ends in a draw. Nobody scores anything, and the next round begins with the same dealer.

Otherwise, play continues as usual. However, for the **remainder of the round**, the player who refused the draw will be considered liable if either of the other players wins.

In some variants, a player must reveal at least 1 winning card of each player to offer a draw. In other words, if another player cannot win by capturing any of cards in hand of the player who wants to offer a draw, then the player cannot offer a draw.

## Scoring Exemption

If a player has no cards at the end of a round (captured nothing at all or captured only chaffs and lost all of them during a round), the player pays nothing even if the player lose the round.

## Scoring in Summary
The scoring in Go-Stop is surprisingly complex, especially when three players are involved! To break it down:

- First, the winner calculates their score, as given by the formula above.
- Then, check for double penalties, and determine what each opponent owes to the winner.
- Finally, check for liability, and make payments as required.

## End of Game
After the desired number of rounds have been played, the player with the highest total score at the end of all the rounds is the winner of the game.

# Yaku
Go-Stop possesses a fairly typical repertoire of yaku. Note that the *Bright Yaku* are mutually exclusive with one another, but all other yaku may be combined freely.

Furthermore, the [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup) may be treated as either an Animal *or* 2 Chaff (not both!), while the [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff), and [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) cards each count as 2 Chaff.

# Go-Stop for 4-6 Players
While at most three players can participate in each round, up to six may participate in the game as a whole. At the beginning of each round, the players decide whether they will *stay in* or *drop out*, in a process similar to [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#hachi-hachi-for-4-6-players).

## The Deal
The deal is the same as for the three-player variation - 7 cards to each player, and 6 cards to the field. The difference here is that the field cards are dealt **face-down**. The remaining cards (if there are any) from the draw pile, as usual.

## The Dropout Phase
The dealer is obliged to participate in the coming round. Starting from the player to the dealer's right and moving anti-clockwise, the remaining players announce whether they intend to stay in, or drop out.

This process ends **as soon as there are three active players**, i.e. when two people (not including the dealer) have elected to stay, or when *all but three* players have dropped out. Once this happens, any players who have not yet had their turn to decide will be either forced to play, or forced *not* to play, as appropriate.

Players who are *forced not to play* may claim compensation for their hand. This is to ensure that players with good hands who were eager to play will still earn some points.

A player earns 2 points of compensation for each of the following cards in their hand:

- The [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup), [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff), and [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) cards

If the player holds 3 cards of the same month, the compensation is doubled.

To claim compensation, the player must reveal all relevant cards (including the 3 of a kind, for double compensation). The compensation value of their hand is then paid to them by each of the two *non-dealer* active players.

> In a 4-player game, if a player holds only the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) and no other Brights, then they may not claim compensation for the Rain Man. This fiddly exception applies only to the 4-player version of the game.

## Finishing Up
Once the active players are determined, the non-active players return their hands to the dealer, who shuffles them into the draw pile. The field cards are turned face-up, misdeals are checked for, and play proceeds as in the 3-player version of the game.

> If the round ends in a draw of any kind, then the cards are re-dealt amongst **the same three active players**. A fresh dropout phase only occurs once the current round has been definitively won!

# Go-Stop for 7 Players
The method described above for 4-6 players works equally well for 7 players, with a few adjustments.

7 cards are dealt to each player, and *none* to the field. There must be at least one joker in the deck in order to have enough cards to do this!

The dropout phase is then played as normal. Once three active players are determined, the non-active players return their hands to the dealer, who shuffles them to form the draw pile. 6 cards are then dealt to the field from the top of the draw pile, and play proceeds as usual.

# Variations
Much like its sibling, [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), Go-Stop has a great number of variations and optional rules, which we will try our best to collect here. Feel free to add or remove these rules as you like!

## Jokers
The jokers included with *hwatu* decks vary tremendously in their design, and are often intended to fulfil various special roles (which are just as often ignored by the players themselves). Common functions of joker cards are:

- The joker, when captured, counts as some number of Chaff cards, typically 2 or 3.
- The player who captures the joker steals a Chaff from each opponent.
- The player who holds the joker doubles their score if they win.
- The player who holds the joker is exempt from double penalties and/or liability.

Every joker can behave the same way, or each joker can have a unique special ability, whatever the players agree on at the beginning of the game.

Sometimes, a variant rule when drawing jokers is applied:
- If a player makes a matching pair in Phase 1, then draws a joker in Phase 2, the joker is placed on top of the pair. The player then draws and plays a substitute card from the draw pile as usual. If that substitute card makes a triplet with the pair (as per the usual rules), then the joker is left with the triplet, and is claimed by whichever player subsequently captures the triplet.

## Small Bombs

If a player holds two cards of a given month, and the third and the fourth card are in the field, then the player may, during their turn, announce this fact and immediately capture all four cards, in a similar fashion as bomb - this is called '콩알탄' - *[kongaltan]* (lit. very small bomb), or '수류탄' - *[suryutan]* (lit. grenade). How to treat this may differ (allow the move only, steals a chaff like bomb but does not apply x2 multiplier, or treats like a regular bomb).

## Whiff

If a player fails to capture any cards for 5 consecutive turns, the player wins that round and scores the predetermined points (usually equal to stop minimum). This is called '허당' - *[heodang]*, or '헤딩' - *heading*.

## 5 Consecutive Draws

If players draw for 5 consecutive rounds, the game ends immediately with no contest (or resets any multiplier).

## Missions

In Korean online Go-stop platforms, one or more bonus objectives ('미션' - lit. mission), which multiplies score like other multipliers (x2 ~ x8) on completion, may be added at the beginning or during a round.

Some examples:
- Before the round or during the first turn a month is chosen. If the winner of the round holds all four cards of that month, their score is multiplied.
- Before the round or during the first turn 2 ~ 4 non-chaff cards are chosen. If the winner of the round holds all objective cards of that month, their score is multiplied.
- Before the round or during the first turn up to four cards are chosen. If the winner has captured any of those cards, their score is multiplied for each captured objective cards.

## Bombs
- After bombing the field, the player does not get the option to skip Phase 1 for two subsequent turns. Instead, they draw 3 cards in Phase 2 and play all of them. With this rule in place, the player who bombed will run out of cards before the others; when this happens, they skip all subsequent turns.
- Sometimes, as a variation of the above, the player only draws 2 cards in Phase 2.
- In some descriptions of the game, any triplets that a player revealed at the beginning of the round can *not* subsequently be used to bomb the field.

## Multipliers for Calling *Go*
The following different scheme for *go* bonuses is sometimes used:
- If the winner called *go* once, they earn 1 bonus point.
- If the winner called *go* twice, they earn a `x2` multiplier.
- If the winner called *go* three times, they earn a `x3` multiplier. If they called *go* four times, they earn a `x4` multiplier, and so on, with the multiplier being equal to the number of times the player called *go*.

## Card Properties
- Sometimes the [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup) is permitted to count as both an Animal *and* 2 Chaff cards simultaneously.
- Sometimes the [![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)Eight-Plank Bridge](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris#eight-plank-bridge) takes the role of the [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup), with the latter counting as a regular Animal card.

## Special Events
- Capturing all four cards of a given month on their first turn will quadruple the player's score if they win.
- Capturing any triplet lets the player steal 2 Chaff from each other player, as opposed to just 1.
- If a player captures 3 or more triplets over the course of a round, they steal 2 Chaff from each opponent.
- If, on the player's first turn, they manage to capture one card of each type - Bright, Animal, Ribbon, and Chaff - then they steal 1 Chaff from each opponent.
- At the beginning of the round, each player contributes an agreed-upon amount to a pot. At the end of the round, whichever player has managed to capture the [![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Boar](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#boar) claims the contents of the pot.
- Alternatively, there is no pot. If a player captures the [![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Boar](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover#boar) on their first turn, they steal a set amount of points from each other player.

## Alternative Double Penalties
- If the winner captured a *Bright Yaku*, then any opponent who has not captured any Bright cards must pay 2 extra points.
- The [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) does not count as a Bright for the purposes of protecting against the Bright double penalty.
- If the winner captured the *Chaff* generic yaku, then any opponent who has not captured at least 7 Chaff cards must pay double.
- If the winner has captured the *Animal* generic yaku, then any opponent who has not captured at least 1 Animal must pay double.
- If the winner has captured the *Ribbon* generic yaku, then any opponent who has not captured at least 1 Ribbon card must pay double.

## The Dropout Phase
- Compensation for being forced to drop out is not paid immediately. Instead, it is paid at the end of the round, by the two losers.
- In the event of a draw, the cards are re-dealt to *all* players, and a fresh dropout phase begins. When playing with the delayed compensation rule above, there will be no dropout compensation that round.
- Compensation is 3 points per valuable card, not 2 points.
- In the 7-player version of the game, any player (other than the dealer) who receives the [![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x)Eight-Plank Bridge](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris#eight-plank-bridge) *must* drop out, but may claim compensation as normal.

## Yaku
- If the *Four Brights* yaku includes the [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man), then it is only worth 3 points.
- *Five Birds* is worth only 3 points instead of 5.
- There is an additional *Six Birds* yaku, worth 6 points:<br>[![Plum Blossom with Bush Warbler](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler)[![Wisteria with Cuckoo](/sheldonchen-cards/40.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria#cuckoo-with-crescent-moon)[![Susuki Grass with Geese](/sheldonchen-cards/81.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#geese)[![Paulownia with Phoenix](/sheldonchen-cards/120.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)
- There is an additional *Three Birds* yaku, worth 4 points:<br>[![Plum Blossom with Bush Warbler](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler)[![Wisteria with Cuckoo](/sheldonchen-cards/40.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria#cuckoo-with-crescent-moon)[![Paulownia with Phoenix](/sheldonchen-cards/120.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)
- The three 2-Chaff cards - [![monthicon_9.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x)Sake Cup](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#sake-cup), [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Yellow Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#yellow-bottom-chaff), and [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#lightning) - are a yaku worth 3 points. However, these 3 points do not count towards the *stop minimum*.
- All four [![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x)April](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria) and all four [![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)July](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover) cards together are a yaku, worth 8 points. However, these 8 points do not count towards the *stop minimum*.
