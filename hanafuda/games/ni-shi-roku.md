Ni-Shi-Roku (二四六, lit. “Two-Four-Six”) is a [Hana-Awase](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for three players, with simple gambling rules. It is thought that the name of the game is in reference to the 2, 4, or 6 shares that could possibly be received by a player, depending on how the round ends.

The game only **features 3 yaku: Four Brights, Poetry Ribbons, and Blue Ribbons.** The gameplay is similar to [Ichi-Ni-San](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/ichi-ni-san), except that **play does not stop when one of the yaku are made; instead, play continues until all players run out of cards.** 

Each player's card points are then counted and subtracted by a par score of 88. **The player with a positive score** receives 1 share each from the other 2 players with negative scores (the winner **receives 2 shares total**). If two players have a positive score, they each receive 2 shares from the player with a negative score (the loser pays 4 shares total)

In addition, players who formed a yaku can receive additional shares from the other 2 players. **A player cannot be paid for all of the yaku they formed; only the highest scoring yaku of a player will be paid for.**

The player who formed **Four Brights** receives 2 shares each from the other 2 players (he/she **receives 4 shares total**). The player who formed a **Ribbon Yaku** receives 1 share each from the other 2 players (he/she **receives 2 shares total**).

The maximum amount of shares a player could receive in a round is **6 shares** (by obtaining a positive score and forming Four Brights).
