**Takame** [高目 - たかめ] is a strictly luck-based 2-player game, and perhaps the simplest of all [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) gambling games.

# Setup
Shuffle a standard 48-card hanafuda deck. Place one card face down in front of each player.

The two players agree upon the amount of money to wager and each put up an identical amount. 
# Gameplay
Each player reveals their card. The card with the highest value according to the [standard suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) wins all money wagered.

In the case of a tie, simply draw another card for each player.

# Banking Variant
This version of Takame is identical to [Batta Maki](/en/hanafuda/games/shoniban), but instead of two sets of 3 cards each, players bet **between two cards** only. The card with the highest value according to the [standard suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) wins all money wagered.
