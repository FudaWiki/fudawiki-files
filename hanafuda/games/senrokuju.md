Sen-Roku-Jū [千六十 - せんろくじゅう, lit. “One-Two-Three”], also known as Maebashi-hana [前橋花] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for three players, with simple rules. 

The name *Sen-Roku-Jū* refers to the target score of the game: 1060 points. 

On the other hand, the name *Maebashi-hana* may refer to Maebashi, which is currently a city in the Gunma Prefecture in northern Kanto, Japan.

# Card Values
The card values used in Sen-Roku-Jū are standard except for the **Chaff**, which are **10 points** each, the same value as **Animals**.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|10|24|

# Gameplay
The setup and gameplay are the same as Bakappana; In each round, players play until their hands run out of cards, then they count their captured card points (there are no Yaku). The winner in a round becomes the dealer for the next round.


# Scoring
There are two attested rules as to how the scoring is to be done. Each rule will be described below.

## Scoring A: Race to 1060
Just like in [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken), the scoring is **cumulative**: Players' points per round are tallied (preferably on a piece of paper). After every round, the players' total scores in the entire game are checked to see if a player has reached 1060 points.

Once a player reaches 1060 points, the game ends, and that player becomes the winner of the game.

## Scoring B: Using Par Scores
In this method, the game lasts for only 10 rounds. The player with the most points after the 10th round is the winner.

Also each player should start with an equal but arbitrary number of points before starting the game.

After players have counted their captured card points, they subtract the **par score** to get the settlement score, and they do the settlement accordingly (negative score means you lose points; positive score means you gain points).

The par score depends on the **seat** of the player:
|Turn Order|Player's Seat|PAR SCORE|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1st|Dealer|**150**|
|2nd|Dealer's right|**160**|
|3rd|Dealer's left|**170**|
