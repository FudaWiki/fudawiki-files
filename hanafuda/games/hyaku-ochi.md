Hyaku-ochi [百落ち - ひゃくおち, lit. "One hundred drop"] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for **two players**, with very simple rules.

The name comes from the target score of 100 points.

A game with similar gameplay but with Yaku exists, called [Issoku Yuki](/en/hanafuda/games/issokuyuki).

# Goal
Reach a total score of 100 points before the other player does.

# Determining the Dealer
The first dealer is determined like in any typical hanafuda game.

# Distributing the Initial Cards
The dealer deals 7 cards to each player and 6 cards on the field. 

> Some play such that the dealer deals 8 cards to each player and 8 cards on the field.
{.is-warning}

If 4 cards of the same month appear on the field, it is a **misdeal**, and the dealer reshuffles the deck and deals again. 

# Gameplay
Just like in Bakappana, the round ends when all players run out of cards.

# Scoring
The scoring is **cumulative** (there is no score settlement); every score obtained in each round adds to the total score of the player in the game.

After every round, players count their total captured card points.

Then, the difference between the players' card points is calculated.

The player with the higher card points **wins the score difference**.

Next, the players' total scores in the game are checked.

**If a player reaches a total score of 100 points, the game ends, and that player is declared the winner.**

If nobody reaches 100 points, then another round is played. **The winner of the round becomes the dealer of the next round.**

# Card Values
The card values are completely standard, the same as used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi).
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|1|24|
