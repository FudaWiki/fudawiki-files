Echobo is a simple gambling game using hanafuda cards. Players try to win against the dealer by guessing which one of the first 6 months of hanafuda is chosed by the dealer.

# Setup
Only the first 6 months of a hanafuda deck is required for playing the game. Card types are irrelevant.

> You don't need to know the month sequence to play the game.

Give 6 cards- Pine, Plum Blossom, Cherry Blossom, Wisteria, Iris, and Peony- to the dealer.

Give also 6 cards- Pine, Plum Blossom, Cherry Blossom, Wisteria, Iris, and Peony- to each player.

Using a standard hanafuda deck, 4 players may participate in the game (1 dealer and 3 bettors), but any number of players may participate if additional hanafuda decks are used.
