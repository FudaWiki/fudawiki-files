<p>Koi-Koi is among the best-known hanafuda games outside of Japan. It is a “fishing”-style game for two players. Its name comes from its gameplay element that allows players to decide whether to continue the round (by calling “koi-koi”) and risk their points for the chance to improve their score, or end the round (by calling “shobu”) and keep the points they currently have.</p>
<p>This game seems to have developed as a simplification of the Korean game of Go-Stop, which features similar scoring and the same risk-taking gameplay mechanic.</p>
