Min-Hwatu (alternatively anglicised, e.g. "Minhwatu" or "Minhato") is a 2-3 player game of Korean origin played using [hwatu](/en/hanafuda/hwatu) or [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). Unlike its popular sibling game [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop), this game is usually played without jokers and does not include a game-stopping mechanic. It also uses a different scoring mechanism and somewhat different yaku.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. A decision must also be made as to how many rounds the game will last - common options are 6 or 12 rounds, or until a certain point threshold has been met by any player. Any other house rules such as which yaku to use should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.
## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.
## Distributing the Initial Cards
Once the dealer has been selected, he or she shuffles the deck and sets up the table according to the number of players. If there are two participants, the dealer sends 8 cards face up to the table and 10 cards face down to each player. If three people are playing, the field will instead receive 6 cards and each player will receive 7. Any remaining cards in the deck will make up the draw pile.

If a complete suit of 4 cards was dealt to the field, they are automatically captured by the dealer.

If 3 cards of a suit were dealt to the field, they are stacked together to signify that they will all be captured whenever the fourth is played.

There are no "lucky hands" [手役, てやく *teyaku*] that would result in points earned at the initial deal in Min-hwatu.

# Gameplay
The dealer is the first to have a turn, after which play moves counterclockwise until each player has exhausted their hands.
## Turns
On your turn, choose one card from your hand to play to the field. If it matches suits with one card on the field, overlap the two, indicating that you will capture those cards. If it matches suits with two cards on the field, choose one of those two to capture with your card. If your played card matches 3 cards on the field, all 4 will be captured. If your played card does not have any matches on the field, it will simply become a field card.

After playing a card from your hand and making a match as is appropriate, flip over the top card from the deck and play it to the field in the same manner as above, again making a match by suit if possible. Once you have played a card both from your hand and the deck, collect any cards captured into your scoring area, organized by card type.

## End of Round
The current round ends when all players have used up their cards.

At this point, all players tally the total value of their captured cards, as well as check for any yaku made, according to the charts in the following sections. A player’s score for the round is calculated as the sum of their captured cards' point values, plus the value of any yaku they captured times the number of players, minus the value of any yaku made by another player. The total number of points distributed each round will always total 240.

The player who scored the most points in a given round becomes the dealer for the subsequent round. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who amassed the most points.
# Card Values
The values of each card are identical to those used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), with the exception of Chaff cards, which earn no points.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|0|24|

# Yaku
There are 6 yaku that are always used this game, but some versions include additional yaku, which will be listed in a separate table.

## Additional Yaku
The following yaku are not always used, and should be agreed upon prior to the first round of play. They have higher point values and thus greater impact on the game than the core yaku when captured, which may engender a more exciting gaming experience.
