Min-Hwatu (alternatively anglicised, e.g. "Minhwatu" or "Minhato") is a 2-3 player game of Korean origin played using [hwatu](/en/hanafuda/hwatu) or [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). Unlike its popular sibling game [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop), this game is usually played without jokers, does not include a game-stopping mechanic, and is scored quite differently.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. A decision must also be made as to how many rounds the game will last - common options are 6 or 12 rounds. Any other house rules such as which yaku to use should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.
## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.
## Distributing the Initial Cards
Eight cards are distributed to each player, and eight to the table. While there is no required method for this distribution, it is common for the dealer to give four to their opponent, four to the table, four to themself, and then repeat.
