Min-Hwatu (alternatively anglicised, e.g. "Minhwatu" or "Minhato") is a 2-3 player game of Korean origin played using [hwatu](/en/hanafuda/hwatu) or [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). Unlike its popular sibling game [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop), this game is usually played without jokers, does not include a game-stopping mechanic, and is scored quite differently.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. A decision must also be made as to how many rounds the game will last - common options are 6 or 12 rounds. Any other house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.
