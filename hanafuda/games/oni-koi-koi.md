Oni Koi-koi [鬼こいこい - おにこいこい] is a [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) variant for 2 players, played in the Gifu region in Japan.

Its rules are identical to Koi-koi, but the Phoenix card is used as a wild card [鬼札 - おにふだ, *onifuda*].

[![Paulownia with Phoenix](/sheldonchen-cards/120.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)

The rules says that if you have the Phoenix card in your hand, it becomes an exposed card [さらし札 - さらしふだ, *sarashifuda*]. 

> It is not known if it means that it can be used as a wild card after being exposed, or if it goes directly to your captured cards like in [Tensho](/en/hanafuda/games/tensho). **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**

If the Phoenix card is dealt on the field, or drawn from the draw pile, it may be matched with a card of **any suit**, as long as it is **not a Chaff**.
