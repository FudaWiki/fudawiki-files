Ichi-Ni-San (一二三, lit. "One-Two-Three") is a [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for three players. It is thought that the name of the game is in reference to the 1, 2, or 3 shares that are at stake each round, depending on how the round ends.

The game only features 3 yaku: Four Brights, Poetry Ribbons, and Blue Ribbons. Play stops when one of the yaku are made, at which point each player pays the winner 3 shares for Four Brights or 2 shares for either of the Ribbon yaku. If all players run out of cards before a yaku is made, the player with the greatest number of card points receives 1 share from each other player.
