*Bakappana* [馬鹿っ花 - ばかっぱな, lit. "foolish flowers"] is a name applied to simplified hanafuda fishing games. As with the name "[Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase)," it may refer to a number of different games, depending on the source and time period in question.
# Variations
## General Scoring
Traditionally, this game featured zero-sum scoring each round, meaning that any points gained by one player would be lost by another, resulting in the sum of all players' scores equalling zero. This is especially useful when played as a gambling game, as it makes it clear who is up or down what amount of money.

That said, there are also versions of this game wherein each player's score is independent of all the others, meaning only addition need be performed, and nobody's score enters negative numbers, which may make calculation easier for some.
## 88 vs 80
Many older books refer to two broad varieties of Bakappana, differing only by the point value of the Chaff cards. Both varieties use the standard points for Brights, Animals, and Ribbons: 20, 10, and 5, respectively. The *88 no bakappana* variant treats Chaff as worth 1 point apiece, whereas the *80 no bakappana* variant treats Chaff as worth no points. 

The result is that scoring is considerably easier to calculate in *80 no bakappana*, with comparison scores of 120, 80, or 60 points for each player in the 2-, 3-, or 4-player versions, as opposed to 132, 88, or 66 points in *88 no bakappana*.

## Yaku
Originally, Bakappana featured no yaku, and only card values played any role in scoring. This is the version of the game recorded in the 1921 Department of Justice report on gambling, and the version playable in the 2019 MocoGame iOS application.

However, later on, this name was applied to games featuring yaku, making the term "Bakappana" synonymous with "Hana-Awase." This is the game described in the 1948 Gambling Criminal Arrest Summary.
