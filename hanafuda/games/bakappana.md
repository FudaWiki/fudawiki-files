*Bakappana* [馬鹿っ花 - ばかっぱな, lit. "foolish flowers"] is a name applied to simplified hanafuda fishing games. As with the name "[Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase)," it may refer to a number of different games, depending on the source and time period in question.
# Variations
## General Scoring

## 88 vs 80
Many older books refer to two broad varieties of Bakappana, differing only by the point value of the Chaff cards. Both varieties use the standard points for Brights, Animals, and Ribbons: 20, 10, and 5, respectively. The *88 no bakappana* variant treats Chaff as worth 1 point apiece, whereas the *80 no bakappana* variant treats Chaff as worth no points.
