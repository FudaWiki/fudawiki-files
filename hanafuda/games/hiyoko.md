**Hiyoko** (ひよこ, 'chick') is a Hanafuda game for 2 players. It is also known as **Shosho** (しょっしょ).

The game shares a similarity with [Poka](/hanafuda/games/poka).

A variant of this game exists, called [Isuri](#isuri-hiyoko-variant).


# Hanafuda Month Sequence
Unlike Poka which uses the standard month sequence, Hiyoko follows the **Nagoya** sequence.
>You must be familiar with the [**month sequence**](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) to play the game.

# Setup
The game uses **45 cards** from a standard Hanafuda deck. Remove all **3 Paulownia** ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) **Chaffs** from the deck before playing.

Players determine first who is the dealer. The dealer then shuffles the cards and deals **6** cards to each player, and **1** card on the table face up (this becomes the **discard pile**). The remaining cards are put on the table face down as the **draw pile**.

# Gameplay
Dealer plays first.

During a player's turn, he/she looks at the topmost card in the discard pile, and then **discards from his/her hand a card of the next month**.

*Example: There is a July ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x) card on the discard pile.
Player must discard a **August** ![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x) card.*

>If the card on the discard pile is a December ![Icon for month 2](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x) card, you must discard a January ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x) card.
{.is-info}

After the player has discarded, he/she may also discard another card of the next month from the previously discarded card, and **keep discarding until he/she doesn't have a card in the month sequence**.

*Example: There is a July ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x) card on the discard pile.
Player has an August ![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x), and September ![Icon for month 9](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x) card in his/her hand.
Player discards the **August** card, then the **September** card.*

If the **dealer doesn't have a card of the next month** in his/her hand **during his/her first turn**, he/she **passes** his/her turn to the other player. If the other player also doesn't have a card of the next month in his/her hand and passes his/her turn back to the dealer, the **dealer draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

If the **dealer discards a card(s), then passes the turn** to the other player, and the other player **doesn't have a card of the next month** in his/her hand and **passes** the turn back to the dealer, the **dealer draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

If the **other player discards a card(s), then passes the turn** to the dealer, and the dealer **doesn't have a card of the next month** in his/her hand and **passes** the turn back to the other player, the **other player draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

In all cases, the player who drew a card and put it on the discard pile must discard a card of the next month from the new top card of the discard pile afterward. 

>NOTE: Some situations were left unexplained. *(What happens when the player who drew a card doesn't have a card of the next month?)*
{.is-warning}

> If the draw pile runs out of cards, form a new deck by taking all cards from the discard pile except for the top card. Shuffle the deck and put it back on the table face down.
{.is-info}

# One-Two Combo
If the card on the discard pile is **January** ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x), and you have both a **January** ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x) and a **February**![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x) card in your hand, instead of just discarding the February card, **you can discard the January card first before discarding the February card**.

# Ghost Cards
In Hiyoko, there are **10 Ghost Cards** (化札 [ばけふだ, *bake-fuda*]). These are considered special cards in the game.

The first five cards in the list can be **counted as a Ghost Card either in the hand or on the discard pile**. They can be discarded if the top card on the discard pile is a month before any of the months assigned to the Ghost Card. Also, if they are on the discard pile, They can be followed with a card of the next month from any of the months assigned to the Ghost Card.

|Ghost Card|Description|
|:---:|:---:|
|The (January) Crane:<br>[![Pine With Crane](/sheldonchen-cards/10.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun)|Counts as January to October.|
|The January Ribbon:<br>[![Pine With Poetry Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/11.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#poetry-ribbon)|Counts as January to October.|
|The (February) Rain Man:<br>[![Willow with Rain Man](/sheldonchen-cards/110.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man)|Counts as February to November.|
|The February Ribbon:<br>[![Willow with Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/112.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#plain-ribbon)|Counts as February to October.|
|The March Ribbon:<br>[![Cherry Blossom with Poetry Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/31.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon)|Counts as all months.|

The next five cards in the list can **only be counted as a Ghost card when drawn from the draw pile**. If it's in your hand or if it's discarded from a player's hand, only the actual month on the card is counted.

|Ghost Card|Description|

|The (December) Bush Warbler:<br>[![Plum Blossom with Bush Warbler](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler)|Counts as all months.|

# Winning the Round
During each round, the goal is to **get rid of all the cards in your hand before the other player does**. If you do, you earn **1 point**, and become the dealer for the next round.

# End of the Game
**First player to earn 3 points wins the game**.

# Isuri (Hiyoko variant)
Isuri [いすり] is a [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko) variant for 2 players.

The rules are identical to Hiyoko, with some exceptions:
- **46 cards** from a standard Hanafuda deck is used. Remove only **2 Paulownia** ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) **Chaff**. The remaining Paulownia Chaff is treated as a 2nd Phoenix card.
- The scoring system in Hiyoko, which is based on players discarding all of their cards, is replaced with a dynamic scoring system: **A player gets paid immediately for each card they discard.** *(See **Card Values**)*
- If you **pass** the turn, you must place **1 point** on the table as a *Passing Penalty*. The player who gets rid of all the cards in their hand takes all points from the Passing Penalty.
- **You may discard 3 to 6 cards of the same month at once!** You get paid for each of the cards discarded this way.
- If you manage to **discard all 6 cards in your hand in one turn** [総出し - そうだし, *sou-dashi*], you get **10 bonus points**.

## Card Points
January = 10 pts.
Other months are worth points equal to their month number.
