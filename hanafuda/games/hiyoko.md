**Hiyoko** (ひよこ, 'chick') is a Hanafuda game for 2 players. It is also known as **Shosho** (しょっしょ).

The game shares a similarity with [Poka](/hanafuda/games/poka)


# Hanafuda Month Sequence
Unlike Poka which uses the standard month sequence, Hiyoko follows the **Nagoya** sequence.
>This game requires familiarity with the sequence of the months.

# Setup
The game uses **45 cards** from a standard Hanafuda deck. Remove all **3 Paulownia** ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) **Chaffs** from the deck before playing.

Players determine first who is the dealer. The dealer then shuffles the cards and deals **6** cards to each player, and **1** card on the table face up (this becomes the **discard pile**). The remaining cards are put on the table face down as the **draw pile**.

# Gameplay
Dealer plays first.

During a player's turn, he/she looks at the topmost card in the discard pile, and then **discards from his/her hand a card of the next month**.

*Example: There is a June ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) card on the discard pile.
Player must discard a **July** ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x) card.*

>If the card on the discard pile is a December ![Icon for month 2](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_2.png =20x) card, you must discard a January ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x) card.
{.is-info}

After the player has discarded, he/she may also discard another card of the next month from the previously discarded card, and **keep discarding until he/she doesn't have a card in the month sequence**.

*Example: There is a June ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) card on the discard pile.
Player has a July ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x), August ![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x), and September ![Icon for month 9](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_9.png =20x) card in his/her hand.
Player discards the **July** card, then the **August** card, then the **September** card.*

If the **dealer doesn't have a card of the next month** in his/her hand **during his/her first turn**, he/she **passes** his/her turn to the other player. If the other player also doesn't have a card of the next month in his/her hand and passes his/her turn back to the dealer, the **dealer draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

If the **dealer discards a card(s), then passes the turn** to the other player, and the other player **doesn't have a card of the next month** in his/her hand and **passes** the turn back to the dealer, the **dealer draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

If the **other player discards a card(s), then passes the turn** to the dealer, and the dealer **doesn't have a card of the next month** in his/her hand and **passes** the turn back to the other player, the **other player draws one card from the draw pile and puts it on the discard pile before starting his/her turn**.

In all cases, the player who drew a card and put it on the discard pile must discard a card of the next month from the new top card of the discard pile afterward. 

>NOTE: Some situations were left unexplained. (What happens when the player who drew a card doesn't have a card of the next month?)
{.is-warning}

> If the draw pile runs out of cards, form a new deck by taking all cards from the discard pile except for the top card. Shuffle the deck and put it back on the table face down.

# One-Two Combo
If the card on the discard pile is **January** ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x), and you have both a **January** ![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x) and a **February**![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x) card in your hand, instead of just discarding the February card, **you can discard the January card first before discarding the February card**.

# Ghost Cards
In Poka, there are **10 Ghost Cards** (化札 [ばけふだ, *bake-fuda*]). These are considered special cards in the game and each card has its own special ability.

>**UNDER CONSTRUCTION BEYOND THIS POINT**
{.is-warning}

# Winning the Round
During each round, the goal is to **get rid of all the cards in your hand before the other player does**. If you do, you earn **1 point**, and become the dealer for the next round.

# All Out
If you manage to discard all of your cards on your first turn, it is called **All Out** (総出し [そうだし, *sou-dashi*]). You earn **2 points** instead of 1.

# End of the Game
**First player to earn 3 points wins the game**.
