Hachi-Jū-Hana [八十花 - はちじゅうはな, lit. "Eighty Flowers"] is a hanafuda game for two to three players. Its name seems to come from the 3-player variant, in which each player's score is compared to a cutoff score of 80 points. Its main characteristics are its treatment of Chaff cards as valueless, and that all of its yaku are based on capturing complete suits of cards.
# Card Values
The values of each card are identical to those used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), with the exception of Chaff cards, which earn no points.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|0|24|
The total number of card points in the deck is 240, which is then divided by the number of players to calculate a cutoff score. For a 2-player game, each player subtracts 120 from their captured card points at the end of a round to calculate their base score. For a 3-player game, 80 points are subtracted. This means that before yaku are taken into consideration, the total number of points awarded in a round equals zero.
# Yaku
There are 12 yaku in this game, each of which consists of capturing all 4 cards of a given suit. For each yaku claimed, a player adds 20 points to their base score as calculated above. This will give their final score for the round.

The Willow suit has a special role in scoring yaku: its cards may be used to complete **either** its own **or** another suit's yaku (but not both). For example, if a player captured 2 Willow cards and 2 Peony cards, the player can opt to score the Peony yaku. Likewise, if a player has captured all 4 Willows, 2 Pine, and 2 Iris, the player may choose to **either** score the Willow yaku **or** both the Pine and Iris yaku. Note that each card may only contribute to one yaku.
# Strategy
Due to the versatility of the Willow suit for making yaku, combined with the fact that it contains the most card points, priority should be given to capturing those cards. Aside from that, players should aim to capture the highest valued cards before their opponents, as well as capture complete suits or block their opponents from doing so if possible. After Willow (35 points), the most valuable suits are Susuki Grass (30 points), Pine (25 points), Cherry Blossom (25 points), and Paulownia (20 points). All other suits contain a total of 15 points each.
