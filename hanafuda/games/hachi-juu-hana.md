Hachi-Jū-Hana [八十花 - はちじゅうはな, lit. "Eighty Flowers"] is a hanafuda game for two to three players. Its name comes from the 3-player variant, in which each player's score is compared to 80, which represents 1/3 of the total card points in the deck according to its scoring system. In addition to zero-sum scoring, its main characteristics are its treatment of Chaff cards as valueless, and that all of its yaku are based on capturing complete suits of cards.
# Card Values
The values of each card are identical to those used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), with the exception of Chaff cards, which earn no points.
