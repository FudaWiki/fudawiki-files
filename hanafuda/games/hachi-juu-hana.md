Hachi-Jū-Hana [八十花 - はちじゅうはな, lit. "Eighty Flowers"] is a hanafuda game for two to three players. Its name seems to come from the 3-player variant, in which each player's score is compared to a cutoff score of 80 points. Its main characteristics are its treatment of Chaff cards as valueless, and that all of its yaku are based on capturing complete suits of cards.
# Card Values
The values of each card are identical to those used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), with the exception of Chaff cards, which earn no points.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|0|24|
The total number of card points in the deck is 240, which is then divided by the number of players to calculate a cutoff score. For a 2-player game, each player subtracts 120 from their captured card points at the end of a round to calculate their base score. For a 3-player game, 80 points are subtracted. This means that before yaku are taken into consideration, the total number of points awarded in a round equals zero.
# Yaku
There are 12 yaku in this game, each of which consists of capturing all 4 cards of a given suit. For each yaku claimed, a player adds 20 points to their base score as calculated above. This will give their final score for the round.

The Willow suit has a special role in scoring yaku: its cards may be used to complete **either** its own **or** another suit's yaku (but not both). For example, if a player captured 2 Willow cards and 2 Peony cards, the player can opt to score the Peony yaku. Likewise, if a player has captured all 4 Willows, 2 Pine, and 2 Iris, the player may choose to **either** score the Willow yaku **or** both the Pine and Iris yaku. Note that each card may only contribute to one yaku.
