**Suhara-bana** [須原花], is a [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for 4 to 5 players. It is played in the Suhara district of Okuwa Village, Kiso District, Nagano Prefecture of Japan. It features a complicated scoring and payment system (which makes it suitable for cash gambling), including both hand combinations and captured combinations, which makes it reminiscient of [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi).

# Preliminaries

## Equipment
Suhara-bana is played with a standard hanafuda deck of 48 cards.

Plates of go stones will be required for keeping track of scores. Each plate should contain **11 white stones and 6 black stones**; this is called **"hito-moto"** (一もと). Prepare a number of "hito-moto" **equal to the number of players plus 2 extra plates for borrowing**; the two extra plates are called **"futa-moto"** (二もと).

Also, prepare **indicators for the current round and the type of field** in the game. Usually, a set of 12 cards representing the 12 months bound together in a key ring is used for indicating the current round, and a set of 3 cards with "small", "medium", and "main" written on them is used for indicating the type of field.

## Number of Players
Suhara-bana only supports having three active players in each round. Other players may participate in the game, but at the beginning of each round, it must be determined who will play, and who will drop out. This is done via a kind of 'auction' vaguely reminscient of both the bidding phases found in western trick-taking games like Bridge, and the betting of Poker.



## A Note on Scoring
**Suhara-bana, as a gambling game, employs a zero-sum scoring system.** Scores are represented in stones, and **each white stone is worth 4 black stones**. However, the game also uses two other scoring units: points, and hai (ハイ). **Hai** is the unit used for counting dekiyaku values, and is worth **20 points**.

Payments within the game are represented in points and hai are fixed throughout the game; however, their exchange rate in stones depends on the type of field in the game. Every time the type of field is changed, the value of stones becomes halved.


|Field Type|Value of White Stone|Value of Black Stone|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Small Field|20 pts.|5 pts.|
|Middle Field|10 pts.|2.5 pts.|
|Main Field|5 pts.|1.25 pts.|

The game starts at **Small Field**, and once a player runs out of stones, he/she borrows one plate from the futa-moto, and the field changes to Middle Field. 

If during Middle Field a player runs out of stones, he/she borrows the 2nd plate from the futa-moto, and the field changes to Main Field.

If during Main Field a player runs out of stones, the game ends. Players count their stones, minus the stones they borrowed from the futa-moto, and they exchange their stones for money, and afterwards the monetary payments are settled.

# Setup
Game setup involves **choosing a dealer** [親 - おや, oya], **shuffling the deck**, and **distributing the initial cards**. Unlike many hanafuda games, Suhara-bana does not stop when 12 rounds have been played; the round indicator resets to January, and the game continues. **The game ends only if a player runs out of the stones after the futa-moto has already been borrowed.**

## Choosing the Dealer
Each player draws a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Dealing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the deck, and the player to the left of the dealer [(乙 - おと, *oto*] cuts. Then, starting with the player to their right and moving anti-clockwise (↺), the dealer deals 4 cards to each player in turn, followed by 3 card face-up to the table. They then give a further 3 cards to each player, and an additional 3 cards face-up to the table.

**In total, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards to the table face-up to form the field.**

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field to form the draw pile.

* If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then a misdeal is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

* Also, If 3 cards of the same month as the month on the round indicator, then a misdeal is declared. In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

* If a player has 4 cards of the same month in their hand, they must show them to all participants and return them into the deck. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals the player four new cards.

> ![6field7hand_3players_setup.png](/hanafuda/6field7hand_3players_setup.png =400x) 
{.is-success}

After all players have checked their cards, the dropout phase begins.

## The Dropout Phase
Each player then evaluates their hand to decide if they would like to play this round, or sit out.

Beginning with the dealer and moving anti-clockwise, each player announces if they would like to play, or drop out. This proceeds until three players have announced their intent to play or until everyone has had their turn, whichever comes first.

To discourage needless dropping out, a *dropout penalty* [ハント, *hanto*] of **30 pts.** is imposed. These payments are held in a pot, which will be claimed by the player who formed the highest scoring dekiyaku during the round. 

> If a player is unable to afford to pay the dropout penalty, then he/she cannot drop out and must play.
{.is-warning}

If fewer than three players wish to play, then the situation can be handled in various ways. If only two players wish to play, then they agree to split the pot evenly (in which case the round is considered over before it began, and the next round begins, presumably with the same dealer).

If only one player wishes to play, then obviously no game can occur. This sole remaining player is the *de facto* winner of the round, and claims the entire contents of the pot.

If nobody wishes to play, then a misdeal is declared; the cards are thrown in and re-dealt.

> Players may also agree to require that three people play, no matter what. As soon as all but three players have dropped out, the remainder must participate in the round.
{.is-info}

As soon as three people decide to play, then any players who have not yet had their turn to decide are *forced out*. These players do not have to pay the dropout penalty. Since these players may well have valuable hands that they were eager to play, one of them could opt to **chase** the players who wish to play until one of them drops out.

## The Chasing Phase

The player who wants to chase declares **"Bou"** (追う), and each player who declared to play, starting with the dealer (or the person nearest to the dealer's right), must declare again whether to play or drop out.

If one of the players drops out, the chasing player takes their place in the game. If neither of the first two players drop out, the third player is forced out and the chasing player takes their place. Players who are chased **do not need to pay the dropout penalty**.

**The player who has chased must reach the par score during that round**. If he/she gets a score lower than the par score, he/she must pay a *chasing penalty* of **20 pts.** to each of the players who were chased.

> If a player is unable to afford to pay the chasing penalty, then he/she cannot chase.
{.is-warning}

The player nearest to the right of the player who dropped out or is forced out during the chasing phase takes the dealer role (he/she gets to play first during gameplay), and the player who has chased sits on the new dealer's left.

Once the active players have been determined, then the non-active players place their hands face-down on top of the draw pile. The draw pile should then be shuffled by the player to the dealer's left before play begins.

# Gameplay
In each round, the dealer is the first to play, and turn to play passes anti-clockwise (↺) around the table. The core gameplay and turn structure of Suhara-bana is typical of games in the *Hana-Awase* family, although it has some additional rules of its own.

## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.
* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player must ***capture the card with the lower score***. If one of cards on the table is a Chaff, the player can choose to capture the scoring card.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player ***must*** capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (see **"End of Round and Scoring"**) to make detecting yaku easier.
{.is-warning}

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion.

## *Shoi-fuda*
*Shoi-fuda* (背負い札) are cards in a player’s hand that, when discarded into the field, could be captured by one of the other two players to complete their yaku (due to having only one card missing from the yaku). 

**A player cannot play their *shoi-fuda* from their hand** (they cannot discard it nor use it to capture a card on the table).

> The player who illegally discards a *shoi-fuda* must be warned by the other two players, and the player must return it to their hand. It is not known what will be the penalty for deliberately disobeying this rule; it is probable that responsibility rules similar to those in Hachi-hachi was imposed.
{.is-warning}

However, there are three exceptions:
* If the shoi-fuda can be played to **complete your dekiyaku** during your turn. You must declare **"Teyaku desu"** (手役です) before playing.
* If **two of your shoi-fuda are of the same month**. You must declare **"Ni-mai mochi"** (2枚持ち) before playing one of the shoi-fuda, and you must play the other shoi-fuda during your next turn.

> If you have both shoi-fuda and non-shoi-fuda cards in your hand, as long as one of the two above conditions of shoi-fuda are met, you may choose to play either kinds of cards.
{.is-info}

> The term 'teyaku' here refers to a card in your hand that will complete your yaku. It is different from the standard definition of 'teyaku', which means a set formed in a player's hand.
{.is-info}
* If **all of the cards in your hand are shoi-fuda**. You must play the card that forms the lowest-scoring yaku that can be completed by another player.


## *Dekiyaku*, *Sage* and *Shoubu*
One a player has played their two cards—one from their hand, and one from the draw pile—they check the contents of their score pile to see if they have formed any *dekiyaku*, or 'built combinations' [出来役 - できやく, *dekiyaku*]. 

Similar to the *yaku* in other games, *dekiyaku* are certain valuable combinations of cards that the players seek to assemble in their scoring piles. A list of dekiyaku and their point values are given [further down the page](#dekiyaku).

* If a player has either formed a new dekiyaku or improved an existing one, then they must choose whether to call *sage* to continue the round, or *shoubu* to end it, as detailed below. 
* If this is not the case, then their turn ends, and the next player takes their turn.


# End of Round and Scoring

The round ends when all players have run out of cards in their hands.

Scoring payments are calculated and settled in two phases: Card points scoring and Dekiyaku scoring. 


The following sections will outline each of these two phases.


## Card Points Scoring
The rank system, as well as the values of the cards, are non-standard, and they are as follows:
|Card Type|Value (in points)|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Brights*|30|4|
|Boar, Geese, Deer|20|3|
|Other Animals*|10|7|
|Ribbons|5|10|
|Chaffs|0|24|
*The **Rainman** is considered an **Animal** card instead of a Bright.

**The total point value of the entire deck is `300`.** Since there are three players, and each player could conceivably earn exactly 100 points (one third of 300), the players are only awarded for card points earned *in excess* of the par value of 100.

> Remember that a player who has chased must earn 100 points or more during the round; otherwise, he/she must pay the chasing penalty to the chased players.
{.is-warning}

### Totalling Scores
Each player determines their score as follows:

`Player's Score = (Total of Player's Captured Card Points - 100)`

This will be the total amount of points won or lost by each player. Players with a negative score must pay points to those with a positive score.

Before payments are done, the score in points must be converted into stones.

|Field Type|Value of White Stone|Value of Black Stone|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Small Field|20 pts.|5 pts.|
|Middle Field|10 pts.|2.5 pts.|
|Main Field|5 pts.|1.25 pts.|

Example: Player A must pay 25 points to Player B.
During Small Field: `25 pts. = 1 white stone + 1 black stone`
During Middle Field: `25 pts. = 2 white stones + 2 black stones`
During Main Field: `25 pts. = 5 white stones`

> If the player's score could not be completely exchanged using stones, then the score is rounded down. 
{.is-info} 

Example: Player A must pay 28 points to Player B.
During Small Field: `28 pts. ≈ 1 white stone + 1 black stone`
(Player A only pays **25** pts. to Player B.)
During Middle Field: `28 pts. ≈ 2 white stones + 3 black stones`
(Player A only pays **27.5** pts. to Player B.)
During Main Field: `28 pts. ≈ 5 white stones + 2 black stones`
(Player A only pays **27.5** pts. to Player B.)

> In the (unlikely) event of a tie between all 3 players, then the entire round is considered "misdealt" and the entire round must be started all over again.
{.is-info}

The player with the highest score becomes the dealer for the next round. If two players are tied, the player nearest to the dealer's left becomes the dealer for the next round.

## Dekiyaku Scoring
After the card points have been settled, players then check their captured cards for Dekiyaku.

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION BEYOND THIS POINT

If no player has managed to form any *dekiyaku*, then the players count the point values of the cards in their score pile to determine the winner. The values of the cards are standard, as follows:
|Card Type|Value (in points, not *kan!*)|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|1|24|
**The total point value of the entire deck is `264`.** Since there are three players, and each player could conceivably earn exactly 88 points (one third of 264), the players are only awarded for card points earned *in excess* of the par value of 88.

Before scoring is calculated, however, there are three special circumstances that need to be checked for. These unique situations **cancel all other forms of scoring**, including *teyaku* payments. *(Remember that the field multiplier still applies!)*

|Case|Description|
|:---|:---|
|***All Eights***|*All Eights* [総八 - そうはち, *souhachi*] occurs when every player has captured exactly 88 card points. In this situation, the dealer claims 10 *kan* from each opponent. The dealer is the winner of the round, and remains dealer for the next.|
|***Double Eights***|*Double Eights* [二八 - ふたはち, *futahachi*] occurs when a single player scores at least 80 above the par value, i.e. when they capture 168 or more total card points. This player takes 10 *kan* from each opponent, plus 1 additional *kan* for every point above 168. This player is the winner of the round, and becomes the dealer for the next.|
|***Sixteen Chaff***|As its name implies, *Sixteen Chaff* [素十六 - すじゅうろく, *sujuuroku*] occurs when a player has managed to capture at least 16 Chaff cards (for this purpose, all [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards count as Chaff). This player takes 12 *kan* from each opponent, plus an additional 2 *kan* for every Chaff card in excess of 16. They will be the winner of the round, and become the dealer for the next.|

> If the *Sixteen Chaff* situation occurs together with either *All Eights* or *Double Eights*, then the latter take precedence.
{.is-info}

### Totalling Scores
Assuming that none of *All Eights*, *Double Eights* or *Sixteen Chaff* have occured, then points are awarded as follows.

First, the teyaku payments from the beginning of the round are made.

Then, each player determines their score as follows:

`Player's Score = (Total of Player's Captured Card Points - 88) x Field Multiplier`

This will be the total amount of points won or lost by each player. When playing with chips or tokens, players with a negative score pay chips to those with a positive score.

The winner of the round is the player with the highest total captured card points. This player will become the dealer for the next round.

> In the (unlikely) event of a tie here, the winner is the player who is *earliest* in the turn order.
{.is-info}

## Special Achievements
Once the scoring is completed—regardless of which method was used, or whether any dekiyaku were made—and the winner of the round determined, there is a final exchange of points for certain special achievements the players may have accomplished during the round.

> **Special achievements do *not* apply if any of *All Eights*, *Double Eights*, or *Sixteen Chaff* occured**, since these rare circumstances cancel all other forms of scoring.
{.is-warning}

*Remember, the field multiplier applies to special achievements, too! It applies to everything!*

### Diving
*Diving* [飛び込み - とびこみ, *tobikomi*], sometimes known as *Catching the Triplet*, is attainable by any player who declared a Group A teyaku that includes a Triplet or Standing Triplet, but *not* a Four of a Kind.

If this player, by the end of the round, has managed to capture all four cards of the Triplet's month, then they are paid 1 *kan* by each opponent.

> Sometimes, a *liability* rule is applied: If one of the opponents willingly placed the final month card on the field to be captured, and the player aiming for the *diving* bonus captures it on their very next turn, then that opponent pays 2 *kan*, and the other pays nothing.<br><br>This does not apply if the opponent played that card on their final turn (since they have no choice in the matter).
{.is-info}

### Escape
*Escape* [抜け役 - ぬけやく, *nukeyaku*] is available to any player who claimed a Group B teyaku other than *One Bright*.

If this player, by the end of the round, has managed to capture 89 or more total card points, then they are paid 1 *kan* by each opponent.

# End of the Game
The game proceeds for as many rounds as were agreed upon—typically 12. Once all the rounds have been played, the player with the highest total score is the winner.

# Dekiyaku
Hachi-Hachi is notably slim on *dekiyaku* compared to other *Hana-Awase* fishing games. The ones it does have are all common to multiple other games.

*Five Brights* and *Four Brights* are mutually exclusive, but outside of that, all points earned from dekiyaku are cumulative.

> A *liability* rule is sometimes applied to the *Four Brights*, *Poetry Ribbons* and *Blue Ribbons* dekiyaku, along with *Boar, Deer, Butterflies* if included.<br><br>If a player is one card short of possessing one of these dekiyaku, an opponent deliberately leaves the remaining card on the table to be captured, and the player captures it on their very next turn, then the discarding opponent pays *double* what they otherwise would for that dekiyaku at scoring time, while the other opponent pays nothing for it.<br><br>This does not apply if the opponent plays that card during their very last turn (since they have no choice in the matter).
{.is-info}

# Hachi-Hachi for Two Players
While Hachi-Hachi works best with a minimum of three players, it can be adapted for two players with a few adjustments. It may occasionally occur during a game with 4+ players if, during the drop-out phase, all but two players drop out.

The deal is the same as for three players- 7 cards in each player's hand, 6 on the field, and the remainder of the deck as a draw pile.

The game then proceeds as in the three player version. The field multiplier is determined, teyaku are claimed, the round is played, and scores are determined at the end. There are only two differences:

Firstly, special achievements are not recognised, and neither are *All Eights*, *Double Eights*, or *Sixteen Chaff*.

Secondly, if the round ends without any dekiyaku being formed, then the scoring is slightly different. While each player still counts their captured card points to determine the winner, comparing against the par value of 88 only makes sense with three players. Instead, the players calculate the following:

`Payment = (Winner's Total Card Points - Loser's Total Card Points) x Field Multiplier`

This amount is then paid to the winner by the loser.

# Hachi-Hachi for 4-6 Players
While only three players take part in any given round—using the rules as described above—it is entirely possible for 4-6 players to participate in the game as a whole. Indeed, many accounts consider it preferable to have a minimum of 4 players, since this introduces an additional drop-out phase at the beginning of each round and adds to the depth of the game.

*When playing with 4 or more people, not every player will participate in every round, so Hachi-Hachi with more than 3 people tends to be played for a full 12-round year at minimum. Campaign games are also seen, in which one full year is played for every person at the table! Whatever the case, the length of the game should be decided beforehand.*

## Initial Setup
The dealer is chosen as usual, and the cards are dealt to each player as previously described- 7 cards to each player and 6 to the field, with the remainder as the draw pile.

If 6 people are playing, then there will be nothing left of the deck to serve as a draw pile, but this will be remedied at the end of the dropout phase.

Misdeals are checked for, and the field multiplier is determined as usual.

Then, the players pick up their cards, and the dropout phase begins.

## The Dropout Phase
Each player then evaluates their hand to decide if they would like to play this round, or sit out.

Beginning with the dealer and moving anti-clockwise, each player announces if they would like to play, or drop out. This proceeds until three players have announced their intent to play, or until everyone has had their turn, whichever comes first.

To discourage needless dropping out, a *dropout penalty* [逃げ料 - にげりょう, *nige-ryou*] is imposed. The first player who chooses to drop out pays 1 *kan*. The second pays 1 and a half *kan*, the third pays 2 *kan*, and so on, with the fee increasing by half a *kan* each time. These payments are held in a pot, which will be claimed by the player who wins the round.

If fewer than three players wish to play, then the situation can be handled in various ways. If only two players wish to play, then they may either agree to split the pot evenly (in which case the round is considered over before it began, and the next round begins, presumably with the same dealer), or they may compete for its contents by playing a round of 2 player Hachi-Hachi.

If only one player wishes to play, then obviously no game can occur. This sole remaining player is the *de facto* winner of the round, and claims the entire contents of the pot.

If nobody wishes to play, then a misdeal is declared; the cards are thrown in and re-dealt.

> Some versions of the game require that three people play, no matter what. As soon as all but three players have dropped out, the remainder must participate in the round. Sometimes this restriction is only imposed in the later rounds of the game.
{.is-info}

As soon as three people decide to play, then any players who have not yet had their turn to decide are *forced out* [追い込み - おいこみ, *oikomi*]. Since these players may well have valuable hands that they were eager to play, they are paid *hand compensation* based on the value of their hand.

The total compensation is the sum of the following:
- Half the value of the hand's teyaku score.
- Half the value of any complete dekiyaku in the hand.
- 3 points for every card in the hand that contributes to either the *Five Brights*, *Poetry Ribbons*, *Blue Ribbons*, or *Boar, Deer, Butterflies* (if used) dekiyaku, and which are not already included in a teyaku or dekiyaku.

This compensation is paid to the player by each of the two *non-dealer* active players.

> Note that the field multiplier is determined before the dropout phase begins. Because, yes, it applies to dropout penalties and hand compensation as well.
{.is-warning}

> Since the dropout phase is a kind of prelude before the round 'officially' begins, note that dropout penalties and hand compensation are *not* cancelled by the exceptional circumstances of *All Eights*, *Double Eights*, or *Sixteen Chaff*.

If the dealer chooses to drop out, then the player to their right becomes the dealer for the round. If this player then drops out, the player to *their* right becomes the dealer, and so on.

> Some versions of the game allow a player who is *forced out* to barter with one of the players who decided to play, in order to buy them out of the game and play in their place. The minimum amount to be offered when trying to buy a player out should be at least the *hand compensation* value of that player's hand, though room for negotiation is possible.

Once the active players have been determined, then the non-active players place their hands face-down on top of the draw pile. The draw pile should then probably be shuffled by one of the non-active players before play begins.

## Gameplay
Once the three active players are determined, the round is played exactly as described in the main bulk of this page. Teyaku are claimed, the hands are played, and scores are determined.

The winner of the round will claim the pot of dropout penalties, then the next round begins with a new dropout phase.

# Hachi-Hachi for 7 Players
While probably best with 4-6 people, Hachi-Hachi can be adjusted very simply to accommodate 7 players.

This tweak makes use of the additional blank card included with many hanafuda decks. The blank card is shuffled into the deck, then the dealer gives each player 7 cards. No cards are dealt to the field.

Whichever player holds the blank card must announce this fact. This player drops out, and takes no further part in the current round. They are not paid anything, nor do they pay anything to the other players (this includes dropout penalties, hand compensation, etc.).

The 6 non-blank cards in this player's hand are placed face-up on the table to become the field. Play then proceeds as in 6 player Hachi-Hachi. The blank card is set aside and plays no further part in the round. (I suggest using it as a dealer marker.)

# Variations and Additional Rules

## Dealer Hand Swap
After the cards are dealt, but before the players look at their hands, any player may ask to swap their hand for the dealer's hand. Accounts vary as to whether each player can do this only once, or as many times as desired.

> Note that you are swapping *for the dealer's hand*, not *with the dealer*. For example, if Player A calls to swap with the dealer, then other players must now call to swap with Player A, since they hold the dealer's hand.

### Special Achievement: *Dealer's Hand*
If, at the end of the round, the player who held the dealer's hand has captured at least 89 total card points, then they are paid 1 *kan* by *all* other players, including the inactive ones (though not including the 7th player who was forced out by the blank card).

> As a special achievement, these payments are cancelled if any of *All Eights*, *Double Eights* or *Sixteen Chaff* occur.
{.is-info}

## *Mizuten*
After the cards are dealt, but before the players look at their hands, the dealer may declare their intent to play blind [不見転 - むずてん, *mizuten*]. Once this is declared, the dealer is committed to playing the round and may not drop out.

### Special Achievement: *Mizuten*
If the dealer, having declared their intent to play blind, manages to capture at least 89 card points by the end of the round, they are paid 1 *kan* by *all* other players, including the inactive ones (though not including the 7th player who was forced out by the blank card).

Conversely, if they fail to capture at least 89 card points, they must pay 1 *kan* to each of the other two active players.

> As a special achievement, these payments are cancelled if any of *All Eights*, *Double Eights* or *Sixteen Chaff* occur.

## The Full Campaign
A full-length 'campaign' of Hachi-Hachi is typically played in the following manner, facilitated by the items found in a Hachi-Hachi play set.

These sets include go stones to serve as score tokens - black being 1 point, and white being 1 *kan* - along with baskets for each player to store them in. It also includes a number of *kanfuda*, or *kan* cards. These are small tokens bearing numbers - 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 being common ones - which are each worth their face value in *kan*.

At the beginning of the game, each player receives a starting number of points- for example, 25 *kan*- from the bank, which represents their *buy-in*.

Each player then immediately pays a pre-determined amount - for example, 5 *kan* - into a *prize pot* [褒美 - ほうび, *houbi*], which will be claimed by the final winner.

Hence, each player begins the game with an amount of go stones equal to their buy-in, minus the pot payment- in this example, 20 *kan*.

Play as many years (sets of 12 rounds) as there are players at the table. The play set includes a token shaped like a *war fan* to track the field multiplier, and a *mizuten* token to track when the dealer has gone in blind.

At the end of each round, the winner of the round puts 1 point in a dedicated pot, so that by the end of the year it will contain 12 points (1 *kan*, in the dozenal system). Often, this 'pot' is the lid of the box in which the play set is packaged, and possesses 12 small labelled intendations in which the stones are placed.

This 'pot' [番個板 - ばんこいた, *bankoita* (lit. 'round-counting board')] is used to help track the months, and at the end of the year its contents are given to the player with the fewest (or most, depending on source) total points.

Should a player run out of chips, they may borrow more from the bank. These loans come in fixed units, for example of 50 *kan*, and each is accompanied by a token indicating the debt. (In Nintendo play sets, these debt tokens are shaped like *daruma* dolls.)

The player with the highest total score at any point is known as *ginmi* [吟味 - ぎんみ, *ginmi*]. The play set includes a medal token, which is held by whichever player is currently *ginmi*. If a player is *ginmi* for three rounds in a row, they earn a bonus of 10 *kan* from each other player.

The player with the most total points at the end of the campaign is the winner. This player receives the contents of the prize pot. (in the event of a tie, this pot can be split.)

Lastly, debts must be settled. Each player subtracts their 25 *kan* buy-in (with an additional 50 *kan* subtracted for every debt token) to obtain their final scores.
