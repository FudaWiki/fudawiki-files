**Suhara-bana** [須原花], is a [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for 4 to 5 players. It is played in the Suhara district of Okuwa Village, Kiso District, Nagano Prefecture of Japan. It features a complicated scoring and payment system (which makes it suitable for cash gambling), a large amount of captured combinations, and many gameplay mechanics comparable to those of [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi).

# Preliminaries

## Equipment
Suhara-bana is played with a standard hanafuda deck of 48 cards.

Plates of go stones will be required for keeping track of scores. Each plate should contain **11 white stones and 6 black stones**; this is called **"hito-moto"** (一もと). Prepare a number of "hito-moto" **equal to the number of players plus 2 extra plates for borrowing**; the two extra plates are called **"futa-moto"** (二もと).

Also, prepare **indicators for the current round and the type of field** in the game. Usually, a set of 12 cards representing the 12 months bound together in a key ring is used for indicating the current round, and a set of 3 cards with "small", "medium", and "main" written on them is used for indicating the type of field.

For the purpose of these rules, it is assumed that players are not playing for money. Prepare pieces of paper with numbers on them, which will represent the final scores of the game. (5 pieces of '**100**', 50 pieces of '**10**', and 50 pieces of '**5**'.)

## Number of Players
Suhara-bana is usually played with 4 to 5 players. However, the game only supports having three active players in each round. Other players may participate in the game, but at the beginning of each round, it must be determined who will play, and who will drop out. This is done via a kind of 'auction' vaguely reminscient of both the bidding phases found in western trick-taking games like Bridge, and the betting of Poker.



## A Note on Scoring
**Suhara-bana, as a gambling game, employs a zero-sum scoring system.** Scores are represented in stones, and **each white stone is worth 4 black stones**. However, the game also uses two other scoring units: points, and hai (ハイ). **Hai** is the unit used for counting dekiyaku values, and is worth **20 points**.

Payments within the game are represented in points and hai are fixed throughout the game; however, their exchange rate in stones depends on the type of field in the game. Every time the type of field is changed, the value of stones becomes halved.


|Field Type|Value of White Stone|Value of Black Stone|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Small Field|20 pts.|5 pts.|
|Middle Field|10 pts.|2.5 pts.|
|Main Field|5 pts.|1.25 pts.|

The game starts at **Small Field**, and once a player runs out of stones, he/she borrows one plate from the futa-moto, and the field changes to Middle Field. 

If during Middle Field a player runs out of stones, he/she borrows the 2nd plate from the futa-moto, and the field changes to Main Field.

If during Main Field a player runs out of stones, the game ends. Players count their stones, minus the stones they borrowed from the futa-moto, and they exchange their stones for money, and afterwards the monetary payments are settled.

# Setup
Game setup involves **choosing a dealer** [親 - おや, oya], **shuffling the deck**, and **distributing the initial cards**. Unlike many hanafuda games, Suhara-bana does not stop when 12 rounds have been played; the round indicator resets to January, and the game continues. **The game ends only if a player runs out of the stones after the futa-moto has already been borrowed.**

## Choosing the Dealer
Each player draws a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Dealing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the deck, and the player to the left of the dealer [(乙 - おと, *oto*] cuts. Then, starting with the player to their right and moving anti-clockwise (↺), the dealer deals 4 cards to each player in turn, followed by 3 card face-up to the table. They then give a further 3 cards to each player, and an additional 3 cards face-up to the table.

**In total, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards to the table face-up to form the field.**

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field to form the draw pile.

* If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then a misdeal is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

* Also, If 3 cards of the same month as the month on the round indicator, then a misdeal is declared. In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

* If a player has 4 cards of the same month in their hand, they must show them to all participants and return them into the deck. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals the player four new cards.

> ![6field7hand_3players_setup.png](/hanafuda/6field7hand_3players_setup.png =400x) 
{.is-success}

After all players have checked their cards, the dropout phase begins.

## The Dropout Phase
Each player then evaluates their hand to decide if they would like to play this round, or sit out.

Beginning with the dealer and moving anti-clockwise, each player announces if they would like to play, or drop out. This proceeds until three players have announced their intent to play or until everyone has had their turn, whichever comes first.

To discourage needless dropping out, a *dropout penalty* [ハント, *hanto*] of **30 pts.** is imposed. These payments are held in a pot, which will be claimed by the player who formed the highest scoring dekiyaku during the round. 

### Dropout Penalty in stones
During Small Field: `30 pts. = 1 white stone + 2 black stone`
During Middle Field: `30 pts. = 3 white stones`
During Main Field: `30 pts. = 6 white stones`

> If a player is unable to afford to pay the dropout penalty, then he/she cannot drop out and must play.
{.is-warning}

If fewer than three players wish to play, then the situation can be handled in various ways. If only two players wish to play, then they agree to split the pot evenly (in which case the round is considered over before it began, and the next round begins, presumably with the same dealer).

If only one player wishes to play, then obviously no game can occur. This sole remaining player is the *de facto* winner of the round, and claims the entire contents of the pot.

If nobody wishes to play, then a misdeal is declared; the cards are thrown in and re-dealt.

> Players may also agree to require that three people play, no matter what. As soon as all but three players have dropped out, the remainder must participate in the round.
{.is-info}

As soon as three people decide to play, then any players who have not yet had their turn to decide are *forced out*. These players do not have to pay the dropout penalty. Since these players may well have valuable hands that they were eager to play, one of them could opt to **chase** the players who wish to play until one of them drops out.

## The Chasing Phase

The player who wants to chase declares **"Bou"** (追う), and each player who declared to play, starting with the dealer (or the person nearest to the dealer's right), must declare again whether to play or drop out.

If one of the players drops out, the chasing player takes their place in the game. If neither of the first two players drop out, the third player is forced out and the chasing player takes their place. Players who are chased **do not need to pay the dropout penalty**.

**The player who has chased must reach the par score during that round**. If he/she gets a score lower than the par score, he/she must pay a *chasing penalty* of **20 pts.** to each of the players who were chased.

### Chasing Penalty in stones
During Small Field: `20 pts. = 1 white stone`
During Middle Field: `20 pts. = 2 white stones`
During Main Field: `20 pts. = 4 white stones`

> If a player is unable to afford to pay the chasing penalty, then he/she cannot chase.
{.is-warning}

The player nearest to the right of the player who dropped out or is forced out during the chasing phase takes the dealer role (he/she gets to play first during gameplay), and the player who has chased sits on the new dealer's left.

Once the active players have been determined, then the non-active players place their hands face-down on top of the draw pile. The draw pile should then be shuffled by the player to the dealer's left before play begins.

# Gameplay
In each round, the dealer is the first to play, and turn to play passes anti-clockwise (↺) around the table. The core gameplay and turn structure of Suhara-bana is typical of games in the *Hana-Awase* family, although it has some additional rules of its own.

## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.
* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player must ***capture the card with the lower score***. If one of cards on the table is a Chaff, the player can choose to capture the scoring card.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player ***must*** capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (see **"End of Round and Scoring"**) to make detecting yaku easier.
{.is-warning}

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion.

## *Shoi-fuda*
*Shoi-fuda* (背負い札) are cards in a player’s hand that, when discarded into the field, could be captured by one of the other two players to complete their yaku (due to having only one card missing from the yaku). 

**A player cannot play their *shoi-fuda* from their hand** (they cannot discard it nor use it to capture a card on the table).

> The player who illegally discards a *shoi-fuda* must be warned by the other two players, and the player must return it to their hand. It is not known what will be the penalty for deliberately disobeying this rule; it is probable that responsibility rules similar to those in Hachi-hachi was imposed.
{.is-warning}

However, there are three exceptions:
* If the shoi-fuda is a **part of your *Teyaku***. You must declare **"Teyaku desu"** (手役です) before playing.

> The term '**Teyaku**' here refers to **a complete set of Dekiyaku cards** either **completely in your hand**, or **partially in the hand and partially in your captured cards**. It is different from the standard definition of 'teyaku', which strictly means a set formed in a player's hand.
{.is-info}

* If **two of your shoi-fuda are of the same month**. You must declare **"Ni-mai mochi"** (2枚持ち) before playing one of the shoi-fuda, and you must play the other shoi-fuda during your next turn.

> If you have both shoi-fuda and non-shoi-fuda cards in your hand, as long as one of the two above conditions of shoi-fuda are met, you may choose to play either kinds of cards.
{.is-info}

* If **all of the cards in your hand are shoi-fuda**. You must play the card that forms the lowest-scoring yaku that can be completed by another player.

# End of Round and Scoring

The round ends when all players have run out of cards in their hands.

Scoring payments are calculated and settled in two phases: Card points scoring and Dekiyaku scoring. 


The following sections will outline each of these two phases.


## Card Points Scoring
The rank system, as well as the values of the cards, are non-standard, and they are as follows:
|Card Type|Value (in points)|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Brights*|30|4|
|Boar, Geese, Deer|20|3|
|Other Animals*|10|7|
|Ribbons|5|10|
|Chaffs|0|24|
*The **Rainman** is considered an **Animal** card instead of a Bright.

**The total point value of the entire deck is `300`.** Since there are three players, and each player could conceivably earn exactly 100 points (one third of 300), the players are only awarded for card points earned *in excess* of the par value of 100.

> Remember that a player who has chased must earn 100 points or more during the round; otherwise, he/she must pay the chasing penalty to the chased players.
{.is-warning}

### Low Man Out
If a player's captured card points is 15 or less, he/she **automatically wins the round**. He/she receives a payout from every player in and outside the round, and becomes the dealer for the next round. *(Dekiyaku will not be counted.)*

|Captured card points|Low Man Out Payout|
|:---:|:---:|
|11-15|20 pts.|
|6-10|40 pts.|
|1-5|60 pts.|

> If a player has no captured card points, he/she automatically **wins the game** and takes all stones.
{.is-info}

### Totalling Card Point Scores and Payment
Each player determines their score as follows:

`Player's Score = (Total of Player's Captured Card Points - 100)`

This will be the total amount of points won or lost by each player. Players with a negative score must pay points to those with a positive score.

Example 1:
Player A : `130 points – 100 = 30 points`
Player B : `90 points – 100 = -10 points`
Player C : `80 points – 100 = -20 points`

Player B pays **10 points** to Player A, and Player C pays **20** points to Player A.

Example 2:
Player A : `130 points – 100 = 30 points`
Player B : `105 points – 100 = 5 points`
Player C : `65 points – 100 = -35 points`
Player C pays **30 points** to Player A and **5 points** to Player B.


All payments in points **must be converted into stones.**

|Field Type|Value of White Stone|Value of Black Stone|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Small Field|20 pts.|5 pts.|
|Middle Field|10 pts.|2.5 pts.|
|Main Field|5 pts.|1.25 pts.|

Example: Player A must pay 25 points to Player B.
During Small Field: `25 pts. = 1 white stone + 1 black stone`
During Middle Field: `25 pts. = 2 white stones + 2 black stones`
During Main Field: `25 pts. = 5 white stones`

> If you run out of stones while doing the payment, **you pay all of your stones**. You don't have to pay for the shortage.
{.is-warning}

> In the (unlikely) event of a tie between all 3 players, then the entire round is considered "misdealt" and the entire round must be started all over again.
{.is-info}

The player with the highest score becomes the dealer for the next round. If two players are tied, the player nearest to the dealer's left becomes the dealer for the next round.

## Dekiyaku Scoring
After the card points have been settled, players then check their captured cards for Dekiyaku.

The unit of scoring for Dekiyaku is called **hai** (ハイ). It is worth **20 points.**

### Hai in stones
During Small Field: `1 hai = 1 white stone`
During Middle Field: `1 hai = 2 white stones`
During Main Field: `1 hai = 4 white stones`

### Dekiyaku

All Dekiyaku are **mutually exclusive**; only the most valuable yaku is scored. There are a few exceptions (See **Stacked Dekiyaku**).

### Dekiyaku Payment

Each player compares their yaku value to the other two players. Players with a lower yaku value must pay the difference to the player with a higher yaku value.

Example:
Player A has `3 hai`
Player B has `1 hai`
Player C has `0 hai`

Player B pays **2 hai** to Player A.
Player C pays **3 hai** to Player A, and **1 hai** to Player B.


All payments in hai **must be converted into stones**.
During Small Field: `1 hai = 1 white stone`
During Middle Field: `1 hai = 2 white stones`
During Main Field: `1 hai = 4 white stones`

# Awarding the Pot
After Dekiyaku payments have been settled, the player with the highest scoring Dekiyaku takes the pot (where all dropout penalties are placed).

However, if the highest scoring Dekiyaku during a round is only 1 or 2 hai, the player who formed it only takes a part of the pot, and the rest goes back (equally distributed) to the players who paid the dropout penalties.

If 3 players have the same yaku value, or none of the players have a yaku, then the dropout penalties go back to the players who paid them.

|HIGHEST SCORING DEKIYAKU WORTH:|1 hai yaku|2 hai yaku|3-8 hai yaku|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1 player who formed the yaku takes:|1/3 of the pot|2/3 of the pot|the entire pot|
|2 players who have the same yaku value must split between:|1/3 of the pot|2/3 of the pot|the entire pot|
|3 players have same yaku value: |Pot is not awarded.|Pot is not awarded.|Pot is not awarded.|
|Nobody forms a dekiyaku:|Pot is not awarded.|Pot is not awarded.|Pot is not awarded.|


# End of the Game and Final Scoring
The game ends once a player runs out of stones after the futa-moto has already been borrowed.

Players who have borrowed from the futa-moto deducts 250 points from their score for each plate borrowed.

Players then count their stones and determine the final score.

Each “ichi-moto” (11 white stones + 5 black stones) is worth **'100'**.
If there are stones left, each “1 white stone + 1 black stone” is worth **'10'**.
If there are still white stones left, each remaining white stone is worth **'5'**. 
On the other hand, if there are still black stones left, each remaining 2 black stones is worth **'5'**.
(if there is only 1 black stone left, it is dropped in the calculation)

**The player with the highest final score wins the game**.
