Subeta Mekuri [すべためくり] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for three players, with simple rules but unique card points. It is attested to be played in the Chūkyō region of Japan.

The name refers to the fact that Chaff cards (known as Junk [すべた, *subeta*] cards in Mekuri Karuta decks) are very valuable in the game. 

The game may have been originally played using a Mekuri Karuta deck instead of Hanafuda.

It is closely related to another game, [Sanuki Mekuri](/en/hanafuda/games/sanuki-mekuri).

# Card Values
The card values are unique in that they are based on their month number, as well as their card type.

For the purposes of these rules, the following are considered:
- There are only ***two*** **Brights**: The Rain Man (worth ***15 points***), and the Phoenix (worth ***9 points***). Other Brights are considered as Animals.
- Animals that are worth their ***month value*** are called **Special Animals**. 
They are the Boar (worth ***7 points***), the Full Moon (worth ***8 points***), and the Sake Cup (worth ***9 points***).
- Other Animals (except the Geese) are worth ***5 points*** each are called **Normal Animals**. 
- **Ribbons** are worth ***1 point each***. 
The Geese and the Yellow Paulownia Chaff also belong to this Category.
- **Chaff** are worth ***10 points each***. 

> Note that the Bridge card is also worth it's month value: 5 points. However, since all Normal Animals are worth 5 points, the Bridge card is considered a Normal Animal card.

This gives the deck a total card point value of 330 points. Dividing it into 3 players will give the **par score of 110 points.**

# Gameplay
The setup and gameplay are the same as Bakappana; In each round, players play until their hands run out of cards.


# Scoring
After each round, players count their captured card points, then subtract the par score of 110 points to get the settlement score.

`Settlement Points = Total of Captured Card Points - 110`

Players with positive score gains those points; Players with negative score loses those points.

The player with the most points becomes the dealer for the next round.
