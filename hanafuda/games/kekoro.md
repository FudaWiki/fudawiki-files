Kekoro is a fishing-type game played with Hanafuda. Its yaku inventory has significant overlap with [Tensho](/en/hanafuda/games/tensho) and [Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi), and its card values are the same as those used in [Sudaoshi](/en/hanafuda/games/sudaoshi). The game is played for an indeterminate amount of time - generally as many rounds as it takes for one player to exceed their opponent's cumulative score by 90 points.
# Setup
If gambling, the two players come to an agreement over how much to wager on the game. Each player puts up the same amount; the winner will take both shares.

Any other house rules should also be established at this point, in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Distributing the Initial Cards
Eight cards are distributed to each player, and eight to the table. While there is no required method for this distribution, it is common for the dealer to give four to their opponent, four to the table, four to themselves, and then repeat. Sometimes this is done in packets of two instead of four.

Note that there are no Lucky Hands - 手役  [てやく, *teyaku*] in Kekoro.

# Gameplay
Each round, the dealer is the first to play, with players taking alternate turns.

## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.
* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player may choose which one they capture.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player ***must*** capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (Brights, Animals, Ribbons, and Chaff) to make detecting yaku easier.
{.is-warning}

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion.
## End of Round
**The round ends when each player's hand has run out of cards.**

However, there is one other condition that ends the round: If at any point in a round **one player has scored 3 more yaku than the other, they may declare an instant victory**, ending not just the round but the whole game.
# End of Game
**Under normal circumstances, the game does not end until the cumulative score of one player is greater than the other's by at least 90 points.** 

The game also ends immediately when a player claims victory by scoring 3 more yaku than the opponent in a given round, as stated above.

At this point, **the victor claims the sum of money wagered at setup.**
# Card Values
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Chaff|10|24|
|[![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)|10|2|
|[![monthicon_1.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun), [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon), and [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man)|5|3|
|Animals|5|9|
|Ribbons|1|10|
The total number of points doled out will be different each round due to each round ending before the draw pile has been exhausted.

Note that Jun Kusaba instead gives 8 points for each Chaff card and 5 points for the the [![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix).
# Yaku
Each yaku scored in a round is worth 30 points. The same card may be used in as many yaku as possible.

Most yaku in this game come in pairs of Ribbon and non-Ribbon variants; however, Four Seven Eight and Ten Seven Eight only have Ribbon forms.
