**Yari-Tori Tokotoko** (遣り取り床々) is a quick gambling game played by **2 players** after they have finished a round in [Tensho](/en/hanafuda/games/tensho).

Despite bearing the names of [Yari-Tori](/en/hanafuda/games/yari-tori) and [Tokotoko](/en/hanafuda/games/tokotoko), it has a unique setup and gameplay.

# Setup
First, prepare the deck as you would for Tensho or [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana) by removing the 3 Chaff of [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia), leaving a deck of 45 cards. 

Both players finish a round of Tensho, then each player takes 3 of the cards that were used in the game, and 2 "floor cards", to make a **hand containing 5 cards**.

> It is not clear what the source meant by "floor cards". it could be the cards on the field, or the remaining cards on the draw pile.
{.is-warning}

> It is not specified whether the cards need to be shuffled first or not.

# Gameplay
Once both players have 5 cards in hand, players come to an agreement as to how much money to bet; **both players must put up the same amount before the game can progress.**

Once both players have put up the appropriate amount of money, **each player then randomly chooses 2 cards in their opponent's hand**, and then the opponent **discards** those cards, leaving only 3 cards in their hand. Then the showdown begins.

**The winner is the player whose hand has the highest value in the ones digit when the 3 card values are summed.** That player earns all the money that was wagered. In the case of a tie, the pot may be split evenly among the winners.

Note that **the card values follow the [Nagoya suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits)** used in such games as [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko) and [Isuri](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko#isuri-hiyoko-variant). For instance, [![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine) cards have a value of 1, while the [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) counts as a 6, and [![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)Peony](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony) cards each count as 11. **Only the suit order matters, not any other characteristics of the card.**
