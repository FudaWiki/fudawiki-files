<p>Mushi (Insect) is a 2-player hanafuda game played either with a 40-card mushi-bana deck, which lacks the peony and clover suits, or a standard deck with those suits simply removed. Some if its characteristic features are the use of the Storm card as a wild card, relatively few yaku, and zero-sum scoring.</p>
