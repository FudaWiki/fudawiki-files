Ayame Katsugi [アヤメカツギ, lit. "carrier of irises"] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for 3 players.

The rules are almost identical to Bakappana, but with different card values.

# Card Values
The card values resemble a more extreme version of the [Sudaoshi](/en/hanafuda/games/sudaoshi) card values.

**Chaff** are the **highest** scoring cards, while **Ribbons** are the **lowest** scoring. There is no distinction between Brights and Animals.

|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|10|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|30|24|

> The total card points in the deck is **910 points**, which cannot be equally divided to 3 players. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**
