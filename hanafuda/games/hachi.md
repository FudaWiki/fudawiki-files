**Hachi** [八, はち *hachi*, lit. "Eight"] is a [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) [game](/en/hanafuda/games) for two players loosely based on [Hana Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), but with several unique characteristics, most notably its capture mechanic. In it, cards do not generally capture within their own suit, but rather may capture from a specific set of suits.
