**Oicho-Kabu [おいちょかぶ]** (lit. "eight-nine") is a traditional gambling game in which a group of players compete against the banker to assemble a hand of cards whose value is as close as possible to nine.

A simple and widely popular game, it in many ways resembles Baccarat and Blackjack. It also has strong cultural associations with the criminal underworld; Oicho-Kabu is a mainstay of Yakuza gambling parlours, and the very word 'yakuza' derives from the terminology of the game.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, *oya*], deciding the seating arrangement of the other players, and shuffling the deck. Certain ground rules should also be agreed upon before play begins.

## Equipment
Oicho-Kabu is traditionally played with a [*kabufuda*](/en/kabufuda) deck. This simple deck contains 40 cards, consisting of four identical series of the numbers 1 to 10.

Since kabufuda decks are somewhat uncommon, they are often emulated with a hanafuda deck by removing all November and December cards and assigning values to the remaining cards based on month order. So all January cards are 1, February cards are 2, and so on, up to October which is 10.

Alternatively, one can take an international 52-card deck and remove all Kings, Queens, and Jacks, leaving only the pip cards. Ignoring suits (and counting the Aces as 1), the result is exactly equivalent to a kabufuda deck.

In addition to the deck, a collection of chips to represent points will be highly useful. Using different colours of chips for each player will help with tracking bets.

## Ground Rules
Before play begins, the group should agree on the following:

- What should happen in the event of a tie between a player and the dealer. There are two options: Either the result is a draw and the player's bet is returned, or the dealer wins.
- The maximum total bet. This is a limit on the amount of points that can be wagered per round- the sum of all bets from all players cannot exceed it, and once it is reached, no further bets can be placed.

## Choosing the Dealer and Seating
To begin, each player draws a card from the deck. The player with the lowest number becomes the dealer, and the remaining players seat themselves in order anti-clockwise around the table- the second-lowest number sits to the right of the dealer, third-lowest to the right of them, and so on. Since play begins with the dealer and progresses anti-clockwise, there is a distinct advantage to sitting close to the dealer's right.

In the event of a tie, the players in question should draw a second card and compare again.

> When playing with a hanafuda deck, the ranks of the cards can be used to break ties in the usual manner- Brights beat Animals, which beat Ribbons, which beat Chaff.<br><br>With a standard 52-card deck, suits could be used to break ties instead.

# Gameplay
Over the course of the round, each player attempts to form a hand whose total value is as close as possible to 9. Totals that go over 9 'wrap around' by discarding the tens digit. So 10 is equivalent to 0, 11 is equivalent to 1, and so on, much like Baccarat. Similar to other banking games, the players are not competing against each other, but are only aiming to beat the dealer.

Only the dealer has a 'hand' in the traditional sense- the players hold no cards of their own. Instead, four hands are dealt to the table in a step-by-step process, and the players bet on the hands they consider most likely to win against the dealer's.

## Dead Cards
To begin, the dealer deals one card to each player, face-down. Each player looks at their card, without showing it to anyone else, then sets it aside.

These cards are 'dead' and take no further part in the play. Their purpose is to give each player a little bit of insight into the cards remaining in the deck, and what the chances are of drawing each one.

> Sources differ as to whether the dealer gives themselves a dead card in this manner as well. Be sure to agree on this before playing!

## The First Field and Betting
Now, 4 cards are dealt face-up to the table in a row. This is known as the *first field*- each of these four cards will form the basis of a hand.

Then, starting from the right of the dealer and working anti-clockwise, the players take turns to bet on these potential hands. Each player may bet on as many of the four cards as they choose, and may bet different amounts on each. They signal their bets by placing the appropriate number of chips on top of each card.

It is entirely possible for multiple players to bet on the same card- players are free to bet on cards that already have bets on them. (Different bets on the same card should be kept separate, however- different colours of chips will be useful here.)

Note that the total amounts of points bet by all players **cannot exceed the agreed-upon maximum total bet**. Players cannot make bets that would push the total over this limit, and if it is reached, no further bets may be made.

This means that, for example, if the total bet was 50, then the first player could immediately bet 50 points on their turn and prevent any of the other players from betting. This is, however, considered exceedingly rude.

> Note that the first field is *always* 4 cards, regardless of the number of players!
