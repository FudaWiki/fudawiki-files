**Oicho-Kabu [おいちょかぶ]** (lit. "eight-nine") is a traditional gambling game in which a group of players compete against the banker to assemble a hand of cards whose value is as close as possible to nine.

A simple and widely popular game, it in many ways resembles Baccarat and Blackjack. It also has strong cultural associations with the criminal underworld; Oicho-Kabu is a mainstay of Yakuza gambling parlours, and the very word 'yakuza' derives from the terminology of the game.
