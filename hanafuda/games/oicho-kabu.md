**Oicho-Kabu [おいちょかぶ]** (lit. "eight-nine") is a traditional gambling game in which a group of players compete against the banker to assemble a hand of cards whose value is as close as possible to nine.

A simple and widely popular game, it in many ways resembles Baccarat and Blackjack. It also has strong cultural associations with the criminal underworld; Oicho-Kabu is a mainstay of Yakuza gambling parlours, and the very word 'yakuza' derives from the terminology of the game.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, *oya*], deciding the seating arrangement of the other players, and shuffling the deck. House rules and conventions should also be agreed upon before play begins.

## Equipment
Oicho-Kabu is traditionally played with a [*kabufuda*](/en/kabufuda) deck. This simple deck contains 40 cards, consisting of four identical series of the numbers 1 to 10.

Since kabufuda decks are somewhat uncommon, they are often emulated with a hanafuda deck by removing all November and December cards and assigning values to the remaining cards based on month order. So all January cards are 1, February cards are 2, and so on, up to October which is 10.

Alternatively, one can take an international 52-card deck and remove all Kings, Queens, and Jacks, leaving only the pip cards. Ignoring suits (and counting the Aces as 1), the result is exactly equivalent to a kabufuda deck.

In addition to the deck, a collection of chips to represent points will be highly useful.

## Ground Rules
Before play begins, the group should agree on the following:

- What should happen in the event of a tie between a player and the dealer. There are two options: Either the result is a draw and the player's bet is returned, or the dealer wins.
- The maximum total bet. This is a limit on the amount of points that can be wagered per round- the sum of all bets from all players cannot exceed it, and once it is reached, no further bets can be placed.
