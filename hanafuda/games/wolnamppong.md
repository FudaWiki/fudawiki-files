Wolnamppong [월남뽕] is an adaptation of the western card game [In Between](https://www.pagat.com/banking/in-between.html) into Hwatu, and is said to have originated from Korean soldiers who were dispatched into the Vietnam War.

The game can technically be played by 2 to 16 players, although it is best played with 4 to 8 players.

# The Cards
All 48 cards of a Hanafuda deck is used.

> You must be familiar with the [Korean month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) to play the game.

# Gameplay
- Before starting the game, decide first the amount of chips of the ante.
- Choose who is the dealer using whatever method you prefer.
- All players then ante a fixed amount into the pot, and the dealer deals 2 cards to each player, and the rest is put on the table face-down as the draw pile.
- Starting with the player to the dealer’s right, each player must either **place a bet** of a desired amount (maximum amount of the bet is the current amount of the pot; betting the pot amount is called *ado* [아도].) to participate in the game, or **fold** without betting.
- If the player bets, they reveal their hand by placing it face-up on the table, and then they draw a card from the draw pile. If the drawn card’s month number is in between the range of the month numbers of the two cards in hand, the player wins the bet and takes the bet amount from the pot. However, if it is outside the range or is matching one of the two cards in hand, the player loses the bet and places the bet into the pot. Turn then goes to the next player.
*Example: If the two cards are 2 and 10, then you win if the third card is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9; you lose if the third card is 1, 2, 10, 11, or 12.*
- If the player folds, then the turn automatically goes to the next player.
- If all players have used their turns, then the cards are reshuffled and redealt, and play continues starting with the player to the dealer’s right.
- Play continues until the pot is exhausted. At this point, if players want to continue playing, then all players must place the ante amount into the pot to replenish it.

## Special rules
Ilbi [일비] – if the two cards in hand are 1 and 12, which gives the highest probability of winning the bet. However, if you lose, then you must pay 1.5x the bet amount in the pot (2x in some regions).
