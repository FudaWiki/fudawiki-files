Bakabana (or possibly pronounced bakahana) is a 4-player game attested in the Oita Prefecture of Japan. Its basic gameplay is similar to that of other [Hana Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) type games, but it uses unique point values for the cards, and most notably features a different play style for one of the participants each round.
