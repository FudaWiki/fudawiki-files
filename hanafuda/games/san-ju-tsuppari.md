San-Jū Tsuppari [三十ツッパリ - さんじゅうつっぱり, lit. “Thirty Palm Thrusts”] is a [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for three players, with very simple rules.

The name of the game is in reference to the **par score** of the game which is **30 points**.

The game only **features 2 yaku: Poetry Ribbons and Blue Ribbons**. 

Play **doesn't stop when one of the yaku are made**; the round ends only when all players run out of cards in hand.

# Scoring
Players check for yaku, then do yaku settlement. Then they check their captured card points, subtract 30 points from their score, and do the score settlement.

## Checking for Yaku and Yaku Settlement
Players check if they have captured either **3 Poetry Ribbons** or **3 Blue Ribbons**.

Each Yaku is worth **20 points**; in other words, **each of the other two players must give 10 points worth of captured cards** to the player who has one Yaku.

## Counting the Card Points and Scoring
Players count their captured card points, then they subtract the **par score** of **30 points** to get the settlement score, and they do the settlement accordingly (negative score means you lose points; positive score means you gain points).

`Settlement Score = Total of captured card points - 30`

The winner in a round becomes the dealer for the next round.

# Card Values
The card values are non-standard. Note that there are only **two Brights**: The **Curtain** and the **Phoenix**. *(The Crane, the Full Moon, and the Rainman are considered Animal cards.)*
