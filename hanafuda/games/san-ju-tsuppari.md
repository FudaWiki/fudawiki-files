San-Jū Tsuppari [三十ツッパリ - さんじゅうつっぱり, lit. “Thirty Palm Thrusts”] is a [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for three players, with simple gambling rules. It is thought that the name of the game is in reference to the 1, 2, or 3 shares that are at stake each round, depending on how the round ends. This game is closely related to [Ni-shi-roku](/en/hanafuda/games/ni-shi-roku) and [Saburokku](/en/hanafuda/games/saburokku).

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The game only **features 3 yaku: Four Brights, Poetry Ribbons, and Blue Ribbons. Play stops when one of the yaku are made**, at which point the other players each pay the winner **3** shares for Four Brights or **2** shares for either of the Ribbon yaku. **If all players run out of cards** before a yaku is made, the player with the **greatest number of card points** receives **1** share from each other player. 
# Card Values
The card values used in Ichi-Ni-San are completely standard, the same as used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi). Note that captured card values do not matter unless all players run out of cards before anyone has completed a yaku.
