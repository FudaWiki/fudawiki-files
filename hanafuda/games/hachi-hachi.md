Hachi-Hachi [八八 - はちはち], also known as “88,” is a traditional hanafuda game for primarily 3 to 6 players, although it can accomodate 2 or 7 with modifications.  It features a complicated scoring and payment system (which makes it suitable for cash gambling), including both hand combinations and captured combinations.

It is among the most played hanafuda games in Japan, but enjoys little popularity in the rest of the world, where [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) is perhaps the most well-known game. (A New York Times article and a 'Book of American Hachi-ju-Hachi', both from the 1920s, nevertheless suggest it was a brief fad in the US.) Hachi-Hachi play sets are available, generally containing two decks and several implements to aid in scorekeeping. It is likely that today's standard deck pattern, [Hachi-hachi-bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana), takes its name from this game.

Despite being historically unrelated, the game is vaguely reminiscient of mahjong; both feature intricate scoring systems designed with an eye to gambling, and both are sold in dedicated sets that include tokens and various items for tracking the state of the game. And while both have a reputation for complexity, they are fundamentally quite graspable games one you burrow down beneath the layer cake of scoring mechanisms.

# Preliminaries

## Equipment
Hachi-Hachi is, naturally, played with a standard hanafuda deck. Typically, two decks are used- one red-backed, one black-backed- though this is not strictly necessary. While one deck is being played, the other can be shuffled by an inactive player in preparation for the next round. This saves time between rounds, and also means the back colour will alternate with each round, which aids in tracking the current month. (The old 'Hachi-ju-Hachi' book suggests using the red deck for odd-numbered months, and the black deck for even-numbered ones.)

A supply of poker chips, go stones, or other tokens- preferably in a large quantity, and with at least two denominations- will also be immensely helpful for keeping track of scores. Scores can be kept on paper if required, but this is more cumbersome.

Hachi-Hachi sets will include additional tokens for tracking things such as the field multiplier, *mizuten*, and *ginmi*, along with pots for holding payments. Again, none of these items are strictly necessary.

## Number of Players
As with other hanafuda fishing games, Hachi-Hachi only supports having two or three active players in each round. Other players may participate in the game, but at the beginning of each round, it must be determined who will play, and who will drop out.

This is done via a kind of 'auction' vaguely reminscient of the bidding phases found in western trick-taking games like Bridge, albeit much simpler.

For simplicity, these rules will describe the three-player version of the game first. However, this is not to imply that Hachi-Hachi is fundamentally *only* a three-player game, or that it works best with three players. The choice of whether to stay or drop out is an interesting and strategic one, and it is commonly claimed the game is more exciting with larger groups.

## A Note on Scoring
Scores in Hachi-Hachi are measured in two units, *kan* [貫 - かん, *kan*] and points. Traditionally, the game uses a dozenal system, where 1 *kan* equals 12 points. Modern accounts prefer to use a more conventional decimal system, wherein 1 *kan* equals 10 points.

Since points are almost always scored in whole numbers of *kan*, the choice of system does not matter for most purposes. However, there are a few curcumstances which call for scores to be halved, which can produce scores involving half a *kan*. In dozenal, half a *kan* will be 6 points, whereas in decimal it will be 5 points.

Since the value of individual cards is also measured in points, this can likewise affect how card points are converted into scores. For example, a single Bright card is worth 20 points, which is 2 *kan* in the decimal system and 1 *kan* 8 points in the dozenal.

For uniformity, this page gives all scores in *kan*. Pick whichever system of scoring you prefer, then multiply these *kan* values by either 12 or 10 to obtain their equivalent in points.

# Setup (3 Players)
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, oya], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

Like many hanafuda games, Hachi-Hachi is usually played for 12 rounds, one for each month of the year, although 6 round games (half a year) or even 3 round games (a season) may be played. 

However, when playing with 4 or more people, not every player will participate in every round, so Hachi-Hachi tends to be played for a full 12-round year at minimum. Campaign games are also seen, in which one full year is played for every person at the table! Whatever the case, the length of the game should be decided beforehand.

Naturally, house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

This section describes game setup for three players.

## Choosing the Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the initial dealer. A hanafuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.

## Dealing the Cards
The player to the left of the dealer shuffles the deck, and the player to the right of the dealer cuts. Then, starting with the player to their right and moving anti-clockwise, the dealer deals 4 cards to each player in turn, followed by 3 card face-up to the table. They then give a further 3 cards to each player, and an addition 3 cards face-up to the table.

In total, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards to the table face-up to form the field.

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field to form the draw pile.

If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then a misdeal is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

## The Field Multiplier
Next, the number of Bright cards in the field is counted to determine the *field multiplier*. This multiplier applies to *all* exchanges of points between players, for the entire duration of the round.

### Small Field
A *small field* [小場 - こば, *koba*] occurs if there are no Brights. Point exchanges are unaffected.

### Large Field
A *large field* [大場 - おおば, *ooba*] occurs if any of the [![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane with Sun](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun), [![Icon for month 3](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Flower Viewing Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain), or [![Icon for month 8](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Full Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon) Brights are on the field. All point exchanges will be doubled for this round.

### Grand Field
A *grand field* [絶場 - ぜつば, *zetsuba*] occurs if either the [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man) or [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix) is on the field. All point exchanges will be quadrupled this round.
