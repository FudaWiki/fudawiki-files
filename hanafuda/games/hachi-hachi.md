Hachi-Hachi [八八 - はちはち], also known as “88,” is a traditional hanafuda game for primarily 3 to 6 players, although it can accomodate 2 or 7 with modifications.  It features a complicated scoring and payment system (which makes it suitable for cash gambling), including both hand combinations and captured combinations.

It is among the most played hanafuda games in Japan, but enjoys little popularity in the rest of the world, where [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) is perhaps the most well-known game. (A New York Times article and a 'Book of American Hachi-ju-Hachi', both from the 1920s, nevertheless suggest it was a brief fad in the US.) Hachi-Hachi play sets are available, generally containing two decks and several implements to aid in scorekeeping. It is likely that today's standard deck pattern, [Hachi-hachi-bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana), takes its name from this game.

Despite being historically unrelated, the game is vaguely reminiscient of mahjong; both feature intricate scoring systems designed with an eye to gambling, and both are sold in dedicated sets that include tokens and various items for tracking the state of the game. And while both have a reputation for complexity, they are fundamentally quite graspable games one you burrow down beneath the layer cake of scoring mechanisms.
