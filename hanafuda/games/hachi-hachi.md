Hachi-Hachi, also known as “88,” is a traditional hanafuda game for 3-players. It features somewhat complicated zero-sum scoring (which makes it suitable for cash gambling), including both hand combinations and captured combinations. It is among the most played hanafuda games in Japan, but enjoys little popularity in the rest of the world. Hachi-Hachi play sets are sold, featuring two decks and several implements to aid in scorekeeping.
