Sudaoshi is a 3-player [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) [game](/en/hanafuda/games) of secondary popularity, appearing alongside more popular games like [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) in many [video games](/en/hanafuda/video-games) and rule books. It has two major distinguishing features: an unusual distribution of card values, with Chaff cards being the most valuable rather than the least; and the relative paucity of yaku: only 2 that are capturable by any player, and 2 more that can only be captured by the player to the left of the dealer.

## Lucky Hands
The **Lucky Hands** - 手役 [てやく, *teyaku*] in this game are generally the same as those used in Hachi-Hachi. See [here](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#teyaku) for more information.

A variant of Sudaoshi from 1921 only included 4 Lucky Hands, which may be used if a simpler game is desired:
|Points|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|10|**Triplet/Three of a Kind**<br/>三本 [さんぼん, *sanbon*]|Any three cards of the same month.|
|20|**Three Pairs**<br/>喰付 [くっつき, *kuttsuki*] (lit. *sticky?*)|Three pairs of cards of different months.|
|30|**Four-Three**<br/>四三 [しそう, *shisou*]|Four cards of one suit and a triplet of another.|
|10|**Three Ribbons**<br>短三枚 [なさけ, *nasake*]|Any 3 Ribbons and/or [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards. Note that only the second player, i.e. the one to the right of the dealer, may claim this particular Lucky Hand!|

# Gameplay
Unlike in Hachi-Hachi, there are no field multipliers for Bright cards appearing on the opening field. There is also no *sage* or *shoubu* call; ratger, all hands are fully played out, and any point exchanges for yaku are calculated in conjuction with the points for captured cards.
# Card Values
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Chaff|10|24|
|[![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)|10|2|
|[![monthicon_1.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun), [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon), and [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man)|5|3|
|Animals|5|9|
|Ribbons|1|10|
The total value of all cards in the deck is 330. The **point burden is different for each player,** however: The **dealer subtracts 100 points from their captured card points**, the **player to their right subtracts 110**, and the **last player subtracts 120**.

In an earlier variant of Sudaoshi, the [![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix) were worth 5 points rather than 10, and Chaff were worth 8 points rather than 10, which matches with the card values used in [Kekoro](/en/hanafuda/games/kekoro).
# Yaku
The yaku in Sudaoshi fall into two categories. While any player may score points for the two [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Susuki Grass](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass) yaku, only the last player (the one sitting to the left of the dealer) may score for either [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) yaku.

Note that only one yaku may be captured within each category.

As usual, these yaku may be known by different names depending on the source.

# Variants
- For greater or fewer than 3 players, the same [accommodations](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#number-of-players) may be used as in Hachi-Hachi.
- In some variants, only the 2 "Set" yaku are used, not the "Top" ones.
- Since Sudaoshi is often treated as a modification of Hachi-Hachi, the *kan* - 貫　[かん] system is sometimes used, with a rate of either 10 or 12 points per *kan*. In this case, the yaku are set to 1 and 2 *kan* apiece.
