Sudaoshi is a 3-player [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) [game](/en/hanafuda/games) of secondary popularity, appearing alongside more popular games like [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) in many [video games](/en/hanafuda/video-games) and rule books. It has two major distinguishing features: an unusual distribution of card values, with Chaff cards being the most valuable rather than the least; and the relative paucity of yaku: only 2 that are capturable by any player, and 2 more that can only be captured by the player to the left of the dealer.
