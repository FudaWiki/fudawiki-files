Sudaoshi is a 3-player [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) [game](/en/hanafuda/games) of secondary popularity, appearing alongside more popular games like [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) in many [video games](/en/hanafuda/video-games) and rule books. It has two major distinguishing features: an unusual distribution of card values, with Chaff cards being the most valuable rather than the least; and the relative paucity of yaku: only 2 that are capturable by any player, and 2 more that can only be captured by the player to the left of the dealer.
# Setup (3 Players)
Game setup involves **choosing a dealer** [親 - おや, oya], **shuffling the deck**, and **distributing the initial cards**. Like many hanafuda games, **Sudaoshi is usually played for 12 rounds**, one for each month of the year, although 6 round games (half a year) or even 3 round games (a season) may be played. Naturally, house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

This section describes game setup for three players; for more players please see the ["number of players" section](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#number-of-players) of the Hachi-Hachi page.

## Choosing the Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the initial dealer. A hanafuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Dealing the Cards
The player to the left of the dealer [尾季 - びき, *biki*] shuffles the deck, and the player to the right of the dealer [胴二 - どうに, *douni*] cuts. Then, starting with the player to their right and moving anti-clockwise (↺), the dealer deals 4 cards to each player in turn, followed by 3 card face-up to the table. They then give a further 3 cards to each player, and an additional 3 cards face-up to the table.

**In total, 7 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards to the table face-up to form the field.**

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field to form the draw pile.

* If 4 cards of the same month are dealt to the table, then a misdeal is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture). In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.

**Unlike in Hachi-Hachi, there are typically no field multipliers for Bright cards appearing on the opening field.**

# Lucky Hands
The **Lucky Hands** - 手役 [てやく, *teyaku*] in this game are generally the same as those used in Hachi-Hachi. See [here](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi#teyaku) for more information.

A variant of Sudaoshi from 1921 only included 4 Lucky Hands, which may be used if a simpler game is desired:
|Points|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|10|**Triplet/Three of a Kind**<br/>三本 [さんぼん, *sanbon*]|Any three cards of the same month.|
|20|**Three Pairs**<br/>喰付 [くっつき, *kuttsuki*] (lit. *sticky?*)|Three pairs of cards of different months.|
|30|**Four-Three**<br/>四三 [しそう, *shisou*]|Four cards of one suit and a triplet of another.|
|10|**Three Ribbons**<br>短三枚 [なさけ, *nasake*]|Any 3 Ribbons and/or [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards. Note that only the second player, i.e. the one to the right of the dealer, may claim this particular Lucky Hand!|

# Gameplay
There is also no *sage* or *shoubu* call; ratger, all hands are fully played out, and any point exchanges for yaku are calculated in conjuction with the points for captured cards.
# Card Values
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Chaff|10|24|
|[![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix)|10|2|
|[![monthicon_1.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =20x)Crane](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun), [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon), and [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Rain Man](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow#rain-man)|5|3|
|Animals|5|9|
|Ribbons|1|10|
The total value of all cards in the deck is 330. The **point burden is different for each player,** however: The **dealer subtracts 100 points from their captured card points**, the **player to their right subtracts 110**, and the **last player subtracts 120**.

In an earlier variant of Sudaoshi, the [![monthicon_3.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_3.png =20x)Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) and [![monthicon_12.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix) were worth 5 points rather than 10, and Chaff were worth 8 points rather than 10, which matches with the card values used in [Kekoro](/en/hanafuda/games/kekoro).
# Yaku
The yaku in Sudaoshi fall into two categories. While any player may score points for the two [![monthicon_8.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_8.png =20x)Susuki Grass](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass) yaku, only the last player (the one sitting to the left of the dealer) may score for either [![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) yaku.

Note that only one yaku may be captured within each category.

As usual, these yaku may be known by different names depending on the source.

# Variants
- In some variants, only the 2 "Set" yaku are used, not the "Top" ones.
- Since Sudaoshi is often treated as a modification of Hachi-Hachi, the *kan* - 貫　[かん] system is sometimes used, with a rate of either 10 or 12 points per *kan*. In this case, the yaku are set to 1 and 2 *kan* apiece.
