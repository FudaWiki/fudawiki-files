Hon-Bana is a [Hana Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant originating in the Nagoya region of Japan. It is described in a 1927 department of justice document as being the most typical hana-awase game of the region. As with other games originating in the region, it uses an alternate [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) ordering than what is typically considered standard today, along with a different distribution of card points compared to popular games like [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) and [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi). It is most often played with 3 participants; as such, this page describes the 3-player version of the game.
# Setup
First, prepare the deck by removing the three [Paulownia Chaff](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) from a standard [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) deck, leaving a 45-card deck. Then, choose the first dealer by whatever method the players prefer. If the game is to be played for money, determine collectively what each point is worth.

The dealer shuffles the deck, and places it before the player to their left, who then cuts the deck and returns it to the dealer.

Then, the dealer places three cards face-up on the field, followed by four face-down stacks of three cards each in front of him/herself, and then another two face-down stacks of three cards each in front of that. Next, the dealer places three more cards face-up on the field, and adds three more cards to each of the six face-down stacks. Finally, the dealer places the final three cards of the deck face-up on the field.

At this point, there should be nine cards on the field, along with six stacks of six cards each. Each player takes the two stacks closest to themselves, and chooses one of them to become their hand. The stacks not selected return to the play area to form the draw pile.

With 9 cards on the field, 6 cards in each player's hand, and 18 cards in the draw pile, the round is ready to begin.
# Gameplay
Gameplay proceeds in much the same manner as other fishing games, with the dealer going first. On your turn, add one card from your hand to the field, followed by the top card of the draw pile, matching each of them with a card on the field if possible. If a pair is made, capture those cards and add them to your scoring area.

Since the [Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix) is the only Paulownia card used, the player who plays or draws this card simply places it directly to their own scoring area without first sending it to the field. If it is dealt to the field at the beginning of the game, the dealer automatically captures it.

|Ribbons|5|10|
