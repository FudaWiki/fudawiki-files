**Tensho** is a hanafuda game for two players, likely originating in the Nagoya region of Japan. Like some other games from the area, it is played without the 3 [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) Chaff, and it uses an alternate [suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) shared with [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana), [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko), and [Isuri](/en/hanafuda/games/isuri). Other notable features are its two different sets of yaku, only one of which is used each round, and its two-tiered tie-breaking arbitration.

# Setup
First, **prepare the deck by removing the three [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia Chaff](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia)**  from a standard [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) deck, leaving a **45-card** deck. Choose the initial dealer in whatever manner preferred. **In subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round becomes the new dealer.** Player should also agree on the duration of the game - some common options are 3, 6, or 12 rounds.
## Yaku Selection

## Distributing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the deck. There is a specific method of dealing the cards associated with this game:
1. Place **3 cards** face down next to each other **on the field**.
2. Deal **4 stacks of 3 cards each,** face down in the four corners around the field.
3. Place **another 3 cards face down on the field** in a row below the first 3.
4. Add **another 3 cards to each of the existing stacks** in the corners of the field.
5. Put **3 final cards face down onto the field** in a third row, for **a total of 9 cards** face down on the field in a 3 by 3 grid.
6. Finally, add **3 more cards each to 2 of the stacks** in the corners of the field.
7. The remaining 6 cards are set aside as "dead cards" this round and will not be used to play Tensho, but may be used to play [Tokotoko](/en/hanafuda/games/tokotoko).
8. The dealer chooses one of the stacks of 6 cards to become his hand; the other becomes the opponent's hand.
9. The stacks of 9 cards are combined to become the draw pile for the game.
10. Play [Shoniban](/en/hanafuda/games/shoniban) if desired, and reveal the nine cards on the field.

If this is too convoluted, the important thing is to ensure that **each player has a 6-card hand,** and that there are **9 cards face up on the field**, **6 "dead cards"** set aside, and an **18-card draw pile.**
# Gameplay
Gameplay proceeds in much the same manner as other fishing games, with the dealer playing first. However, if there are three cards of the same suit on the field at the beginning of the game, the dealer will instead play second.

On your turn, add one card from your hand to the field, followed by the top card of the draw pile, matching each of them by suit with a card on the field if possible. If a pair is made, capture those cards and add them to your scoring area.

Note that since the ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)[Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix) is the only ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia card used, the player who plays or draws this card simply places it directly to their own scoring area without first sending it to the field. **If the ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Phoenix is dealt to the field at the beginning of the game, neither player can capture it.**

Play continues back and forth with each player repeating the above steps in turn, until either one player has collected an **instant-win yaku**, or both players have **run out of cards**.

## End of Round
**The round ends as soon as a player has captured one of the "Instant Win" yaku.** Otherwise, players continue taking turns until they have both exhausted their hands, at which point they add up the points for all yaku they have collected. **The player who has earned the most points from yaku is declared the winner of the round.**
### Breaking Ties
If, however, neither player has completed any yaku, or otherwise their **yaku scores are the same**, then **the player who has captured the most Chaff cards wins**.

If players are tied with regards to both yaku **and** number of Chaff captured, each player totals the sum of points for their respective captured cards, according to the Card Values chart below. 
# Yaku
As described in "Setup" above, players choose only one of two sets of yaku to count each round. This decision should be made prior to the deal, before either player has any information. If the players cannot agree on a set to use, the choice defaults to the dealer's preference.

Note that many of the yaku names only make sense in the context of the Nagoya [suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits), with "Horse" representing the value "11" and "King" representing "12" - these terms likely indicate that the game was originally played with a deck of tensho or mekuri karuta containing these "court" cards, and only later was it adapted to hanafuda.

Many of the non-numeric yaku names may also be numeric puns - for instance, *yashima* may be interpreted as *ya shima*, "eight islands," or as *ya-shi-ma* "eight-four-horse."
## Both Sets
The first 12 yaku in Tensho are common to both sets of yaku, and thus are always valid. There are two other yaku (Front Elder and Back Elder) that technically fall into this category, but they are listed separately since they change values depending on which yaku set is selected.
