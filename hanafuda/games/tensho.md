**Tensho** is a hanafuda game for two players, likely originating in the Nagoya region of Japan. Like some other games from the area, it is played without the 3 [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) Chaff, and it uses an alternate [suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) shared with [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana), [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko), and [Isuri](/en/hanafuda/games/isuri). Other notable features are its two different sets of yaku, only one of which is used each round, and its complex tie-breaking arbitration.

# Setup
Player should first agree on the duration of the game - some common options are 3, 6, or 12 rounds. Choose the initial dealer in whatever manner preferred. In subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round becomes the new dealer. 


# Gameplay
# Yaku
As described in "Setup" above, players choose only one of two sets of yaku to count each round. This decision should be made prior to the deal, before either player has any information. If the players cannot agree on a set to use, the choice defaults to the dealer's preference.

Note that many of the yaku names only make sense in the context of the Nagoya [suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits), with "Horse" representing the value "11" and "King" representing "12" - these terms likely indicate that the game was originally played with a deck of karuta containing these "court" cards, and only later was it adapted to hanafuda.
## Both Sets
The first 12 yaku in Tensho are common to both sets of yaku, and thus are always valid.
