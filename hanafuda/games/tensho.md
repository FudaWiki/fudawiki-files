**Tensho** is a hanafuda game for two players, likely originating in the Nagoya region of Japan. Like some other games from the area, it is played without the 3 [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) Chaff, and it uses an alternate [suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) shared with [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana), [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko), and [Isuri](/en/hanafuda/games/isuri). Other notable features are its two different sets of yaku, only one of which is used each round, and its complex tie-breaking arbitration.

# Setup
Player should first agree on the duration of the game - some common options are 3, 6, or 12 rounds. Choose the initial dealer in whatever manner preferred. In subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round becomes the new dealer. 
## Yaku Selection
## Distributing the Cards

# Gameplay
## Turns
## Capturing the Phoenix
## End of Round
**The round ends as soon as a player has captured one of the "Instant Win" yaku.** Otherwise, players continue taking turns until they have both exhausted their hands, at which point they add up the points for all yaku they have collected. **The player who has earned the most points from yaku is declared the winner of the round.**
### Breaking Ties
If, however, neither player has completed any yaku, or otherwise their yaku **scores are the same**, then **the player who has captured the most Chaff cards wins**.

If players are tied with regards to both yaku **and** number of Chaff captured, 
# Yaku
As described in "Setup" above, players choose only one of two sets of yaku to count each round. This decision should be made prior to the deal, before either player has any information. If the players cannot agree on a set to use, the choice defaults to the dealer's preference.

Note that many of the yaku names only make sense in the context of the Nagoya [suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits), with "Horse" representing the value "11" and "King" representing "12" - these terms likely indicate that the game was originally played with a deck of tensho or mekuri karuta containing these "court" cards, and only later was it adapted to hanafuda.

Many of the non-numeric yaku names may also be numeric puns - for instance, *yashima* may be interpreted as *ya shima*, "eight islands," or as *ya-shi-ma* "eight-four-horse."
## Both Sets
The first 12 yaku in Tensho are common to both sets of yaku, and thus are always valid. There are two other yaku (Front Elder and Back Elder) that technically fall into this category, but they are listed separately since they change values depending on which yaku set is selected.
