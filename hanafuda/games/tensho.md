**Tensho** is a hanafuda game for two players, likely originating in the Nagoya region of Japan. Like some other games from the area, it is played without the 3 [![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x)Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) Chaff, and it uses an alternate [suit order](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) shared with [Hon-Bana](/en/hanafuda/games/honbana), [Hiyoko](/en/hanafuda/games/hiyoko), and [Isuri](/en/hanafuda/games/isuri). Other notable features are its two different sets of yaku, only one of which is used each round, and its complex tie-breaking arbitration.

# Setup
Player should first agree on the duration of the game - some common options are 3, 6, or 12 rounds. Choose the initial dealer in whatever manner preferred. In subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round becomes the new dealer.
