This version of [Toppa](/en/hanafuda/games/toppa) is played in the Ishikari Subprefecture in Hokkaido. It is described as **"Bakappana but with Teyaku"**.

Since it has a Join-in/Drop-out phase just like in [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), it is assumed the game is played by more than 3 players, but only 3 players participate in the round at once.

The dealing method is the same as in Hachi-hachi; 7 cards in each hand, and 6 cards on the field.

Not much details has been attested, except for the following.

## Join-in / Drop-out Phase
After the dealer has given the cards to each player, each player decides whether to Join in the round, or Drop out.

Only 3 players can join-in the round, but even if 3 players have declared to join-in already, the forced-out players may **chase [追う - ぼう, *bou*]**, by declaring to join-in as well.

> Unlike in [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), there’s no fee for Dropping out, nor are there any compensation for Forced-out players.
{.is-info}

> If there are only two players to begin with, then the above Join-in/Drop-out phase is skipped.

## Chasing
If more than 3 players have declared to join-in, then all payments for the next round will be doubled.

If during the next round, more than 3 players declared to join-in again, then all payments for the next round will be tripled, and so on...

## Teyaku
> The list of Teyaku has not been attested. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**
{.is-warning}

The Teyaku list could be either of the following:
- The same as in Hachi-hachi, but with differences written below.
- The same list as in [Kushiro Toppa](/en/hanafuda/games/kushiro-toppa).

In either case, the differences are the following:
- "Three Pairs" [喰付 - くっつき, kuttsuki] is called by a different name, "sanzokuichi" [さんぞくいち].
- If a "Four of a Kind" is formed, then the four cards are placed face down on the table, and another player chooses one card and switches it with the top card of the deck. The new card goes to the hand, while the other 3 cards are exposed to the other players as a “Triplet”.
