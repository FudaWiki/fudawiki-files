Nylon-ppong or Nairong-ppong [나이롱뽕] is a Korean traditional Hwatu rummy game for 2-6 players which combined some elements of Mahjong into other traditional rummy games played with Tujeon like Dongdang-chigi [동당치기] or Jjeok [쩍].

# The Cards

All 48 cards of a Hanafuda deck is used.

> You must be familiar with the [Korean month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) to play the game.

# Gameplay

Each player receives 5 cards. Remaining cards are placed face-down to form a draw deck.

The starting player of the first round is randomly decided. From the second round, **the loser of each round becomes the starting player of the next round.**

## Turn

1. At the start of a turn, draw a card from the draw deck. If there is no card to draw, the round ends.
2. If 6 cards in hand compose a valid combination, the player can end the round and jump to the scoring.
3. If not, discard a card from hand and end the turn.

## Ppong (or pong)

When a card is discarded, a player with two cards of the same month can call 'ppong' [뽕] or 'pong' [뻥], discard those cards and take their turn immediately. Called player does not draw a card at the start of this turn, but must still discard a card to end the turn.
If a player goes out by calling ppong, the round ends immediately.

## Stop

Any player with only 2 cards (after a ppong) can stop the round before drawing a card if their sum of months in hand is below the predetermined limit (usually 5 or 10).
Some players allow stopping the round only when there is at least 1 other player called ppong.

## Scoring

All players get penalty points equal to their hand sum.
For example, [![Pine With Crane](/sheldonchen-cards/10.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun)[![Pine With Poetry Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/11.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#poetry-ribbon)[![Plum Blossom with Bush Warbler](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler)[![Cherry Blossom with Curtain](/sheldonchen-cards/30.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain)[![Susuki Grass Chaff 2](/sheldonchen-cards/83.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#chaff) is treated as 1+1+2+3+8 = 15 penalty points.

- If the round ends by stop and the stop caller's hand sum is not the sole lowest, the player gets additional 30 or 50 points.
- If the round ends by someone going out, the player whose discard is claimed gets additional 30 or 50 points.
- If the round ends by someone claiming a 6-card combination in hand, that player ignores the penalty point calculation and instead scores equal to the combination's value.

The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds. The player with the least penalty point wins.

# Concealed triplets

Concealed triplet (자연뽕, *jayeon-ppong*) is a common variant. A player with a concealed triplet and a pair can claim a discard and end the round when a card from the same month as a pair is discarded, just like a player with only a pair in hand, and go out immediately. A player with only a concealed triplet in hand can also go out immediately. Scores of concealed triplets are ignored during scoring.

Some players do not ignore scores of triplets during scoring.
