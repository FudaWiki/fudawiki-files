**Nylon-ppong** or **Nairong-ppong** [나이롱뽕] is a Korean traditional Hwatu rummy game for 2-6 players which combined some elements of Mahjong into other traditional rummy games played with Tujeon like Dongdang-chigi [동당치기] or Jjeok [쩍].

# The Cards

All 48 cards of a Hanafuda/Hwatu deck are used. No jokers are included.

> You must be familiar with the [Korean month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) to play the game.
{.is-warning}

# Gameplay
## Setup
Each player **receives 5 cards**. Remaining cards are placed face-down to form a draw deck.

The starting player of the first round is randomly decided. From the second round onward, **the starting player is the player who received the most penalty points from the previous round.**

> In case of a tie, then the starting player is randomly chosen between the tied players.
{.is-info}

## Player's Turn
In each round, turns move counterclockwise, starting with the starting player.

1. At the start of a player's turn, they **draw a card** from the draw deck.
2. If 6 cards in their hand compose a valid [**combination**](/en/hanafuda/games/nylon-ppong#combinations), the player can **end the round** immediately and jump to the scoring.
3. If **not**, they **discard** a card from their hand into the discard pile and end their turn.

> If a player cannot draw because the draw deck runs out of cards, the round ends.
{.is-info}

> Some players do not immediately end the round when the deck runs out and instead reshuffle discarded cards into the deck once or more.
{.is-warning}

## Ppong (or pong)

A player with **two cards in hand of the same month as the card on top of the discard pile** can, instead of drawing a card from the draw pile, **call 'ppong'** [뽕] or 'pong' [뻥], and **discard those two cards** from their hand. They must still **discard a card from their hand afterward** to end the turn.

If a player **goes out** (discards all cards in hand) by calling 'ppong', the **round ends immediately**.

## Stop

Any player with **only 2 cards in hand** (after calling their first 'ppong') can call **'stop'** and end the round before drawing a card **if their sum of the month numbers in hand is below the predetermined limit (usually 5 or 10).**

> Some players allow stopping the round only when there is at least 1 other player who called 'ppong'.
{.is-warning}

## Scoring

At the end of each round, all players get penalty points equal to their hand sum.
For example, [![Pine With Crane](/sheldonchen-cards/10.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#crane-with-sun)[![Pine With Poetry Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/11.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#poetry-ribbon)[![Plum Blossom with Bush Warbler](/sheldonchen-cards/20.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler)[![Cherry Blossom with Curtain](/sheldonchen-cards/30.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain)[![Susuki Grass Chaff 2](/sheldonchen-cards/83.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#chaff) is treated as 1+1+2+3+8 = 15 penalty points.

- If the round ends by **stop**, and the player who called 'stop' **does not have the lowest scoring hand**, that player gets **additional 30 or 50 penalty points**.
- If the round ends by **going out with 'ppong'**, the player who **discarded a card right before 'ppong'** is called gets **additional 30 or 50 penalty points**.
- If the round ends by **claiming a 6-card combination in hand**, that player ignores the penalty point calculation and instead **scores equal to the combination's value**.

## End of Game
The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds. **The player with the least penalty points wins.**

# Optional Rule: Concealed triplet

Concealed triplet (자연뽕, *jayeon-ppong*) is a common variant. 

A player with **a triplet and a pair in hand** can claim a discard and end the round when a card from the same month as a pair is discarded, just like a player with only a pair in hand, and go out immediately. Scores of concealed triplets are ignored during scoring.

> Some players do not ignore scores of triplets during scoring.
