**Toppa [十八 - とっぱ, lit. 'eighteen']** refers to one of several [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) fishing games attested to be played in the Hokkaido region of Japan.

The origin of the name is unclear; the term "Toppa" could actually refer to gambling in general. In fact, in the book "A Study of Gambling and Pickpocketing", by Takeshi Osatake, the game "Toppa" was listed as a [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda) game.

Another possible explanation is that the word "Toppa" is used in Kansai and Chuugoku dialects, and means "stupid". It could be a simplification of a more complicated Hanafuda game (as in [bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana)).

In all games mentioned below, a **standard hanafuda deck of 48 cards** is used, and all Yaku values are measured in **"yaku"**, which can be equated to points or cash.

# Toppa for 2 players
This game is a [hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for 2 players only. It is possible to play with 3 players, but the mechanics are not explained.

In this game, each "yaku" is worth 20 points. For sake of simplicity, all yaku values will be measured in **points**.

Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

**There is no traditional number of rounds for playing the game**; settlements are done after every round, and the game will last indefinitely until the players decide to stop.

Also, decide first whether to write down the scores on paper, or to play with chips, or with money. (If playing for money, then decide first the exchange rate for each point.)

Any other house rules should also be established at this point, in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.

## Choosing the Dealer
The attested method of selecting the first dealer is as follows: Shuffle the deck, and have both players draw a certain number of cards each.

> It is not specified how many cards are required to draw, but it must be the same number of cards for both players. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**
{.is-warning}

Each player then checks the cards they have drawn, and counts the total points of the cards, based on the month of the cards.

All cards from **January to September** are worth points equal to their **month number**. (January is 1, February is 2, March is 3, etc.)

All cards from **October to December** are worth **0 points**.

**The player with more points becomes the dealer for the first round.**

**The winner of each round becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Distributing the Initial Cards
The dealer shuffles the deck, and their opponent cuts. Then, **ten (10)** cards are distributed to each player, and **eight (8)** to the table. 

The attested method of distribution is as follows: the dealer gives five (5) to their opponent, four (4) to the table, five (5) to themselves, and then repeat.

The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

> If four cards of the same month are dealt on the field or on a player's hand, then a **misdeal** is declared, and the dealer reshuffles and deals again.
{.is-info}

## Checking for Teyaku
After the cards are dealt, each player checks if they possess any sets in hand called *teyaku* [手役 - てやく].

A player could claim points for their teyaku by **exposing** [さらし, *sarashi*] it to their opponent; the player must put the cards that are related to the Teyaku face-up on the table nearest to them so that they wouldn't be mixed up with the player's captured cards or the cards on the field.

Exposing a teyaku to the other player **doesn't stop the round**; Play continues as normal, and the teyaku points are included in the score settlement.

> Since it is a disadvantage to play the game with your hand exposed to your opponent, it is up to you whether to **expose** your teyaku or to **hide** it.
{.is-warning}

> If you decide to hide your teyaku, then you cannot claim points for it.

|Value (in points)|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|<h2 align="left">Group A: Set Teyaku</h2>|||
|20|**Triplet/Three of a Kind**<br/>三本ざらし [さんぼんざらし, *sanbonzarashi*]|Any three cards of the same month.|
|<h2 align="left">Group B: Chaff Teyaku</h2><br>**Note**: For the purposes of these teyaku, each [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) card is treated according to its card type; Willow cards are not automatically treated as Chaff cards.|||
|20|**One Ribbon**<br/>短一 [他のさらし, *tan'ichi*]|One Ribbon card, seven Chaff.|
|20|**One Animal**<br/>十一 [他のさらし, *toichi*]|One Animal card, seven Chaff.|
|20|**One Bright**<br/>光一 [他のさらし, *pikaichi*]|One Bright card, seven Chaff.|
|30|**Empty Hand**<br/>総ガラ [そうがら, *sō gara*]|Eight Chaff cards.|

## Gameplay
> **The gameplay is the same as in hana-awase.**
{.is-warning}

Each round, the dealer is the first to play. Turn to play alternates.

## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.
* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player may choose which one they capture.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

> If a card is played that matches something on the table, then the player ***must*** capture, as described above. However, there is no obligation to play a card that matches something, even if the player has one in their hand; they may, if they wish, elect to play a card that matches nothing on the table.
{.is-warning}

> As is typical of hanafuda games, each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are fully visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by type (Brights, Animals, Ribbons, and Chaff) to make detecting yaku easier.
{.is-warning}

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion.

## End of Round and Scoring
The round ends when **both players run out of cards in their hands**.

The scoring for each round is handled as follows: Count the players' Yaku and exchange the difference using the captured cards, then count the card points of all captured cards in the players' possession. Subtract the points with the **par score of 120** to get the score. Loser pays points/chips/cash to the winner of the round, and the winner becomes the dealer for the next round. 

### Yaku Settlement
Each player then checks for any sets formed in the captured pile called *dekiyaku* [出来役 - できやく], and count their points. They must add also the Teyaku points if they exposed it.

A player's Yaku score is as follows:
`Player's Yaku Score = Total of Player's Dekiyaku Points + Total of Player's Teyaku Points`

The difference between the two players' Yaku Scores is calculated, and the player with the lower score **gives cards** to the player with the higher score. 

The total points of the cards given to the other player should be **equal to the difference** between the Yaku Scores.

> If the captured cards of the player is not enough to complete the settlement, then skip this step and calculate the score as described below in **"Settlement when Yaku Settlement cannot be Done"**.
{.is-info}

### Counting the Card Points and End of Round Settlement

After the Yaku points have been settled, players then count the total points of their captured cards.

> Card points are standard except that **Chaff cards are worth 0 points**.
{.is-warning}

|Card Type|Value (in points, not *kan!*)|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|0|24|

A player's score for that round is calculated as follows:
`Player's Score = Total of Player's Captured Card Points - 120 points`

The player with the negative score (loser) pays the player with positive score (winner) points/chips/cash equal to their score.

The winner becomes the dealer for the next round.

### Settlement when Yaku Settlement cannot be Done

If the captured cards of a player is not enough to complete the Yaku settlement, obviously that player becomes the loser of that round. 

The losing player's score is calculated as follows:

`Losing Player's Score = Total of Losing Player's Captured Card Points - Opponent's Yaku Score - 120 points`

The loser pays the winner points/chips/cash equal to their score.

The winner becomes the dealer for the next round.

# Ishikari Toppa
This version of Toppa is played in the Ishikari Subprefecture. It is described as **"Bakappana but with Teyaku"**.

Since it has a Join-in/Drop-out phase just like in [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), it is assumed the game is played by more than 3 players.

Not much details has been attested, except for a few details.

## Join-in / Drop-out Phase
After the dealer has given the cards to each player, each player decides whether to Join in the round, or Drop out.

Only 3 players can join-in the round, but even if 3 players have declared to join-in already, the forced-out players may chase [追う - ぼう, *bou*], by declaring to join-in as well.

## Chasing
If more than 3 players have declared to join-in, then all payments for the next round will be doubled.

If during the next round, more than 3 players declared to join-in again, then all payments for the next round will be tripled, and so on...

## Teyaku
The list of Teyaku has not been attested, so it is assumed that it is the same list of Teyaku as in Hachi-hachi, but with some differences:
- "Three Pairs" [喰付 - くっつき, kuttsuki] is called by a different name, "sanzokuichi" [さんぞくいち].
- If a "Four of a Kind" is formed, then the four cards are placed face down on the table, and another player chooses one card and switches it with the top card of the deck. The new card goes to the hand, while the other 3 cards are exposed to the other players as a “Triplet”.

# Kushiro Toppa
This game is a [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) variant, but with many rules from the [2-player Toppa](/en/hanafuda/games/toppa/#Toppa_for_2_players)
