**Roku-Tan** (六短, lit. "Six Ribbons") is a [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for two players, with simple gambling rules. It is thought that the name of the game is in reference to the **only yaku in the game which consists of 6 Ribbon cards**.

The Dealer deals 8 cards to each player and 8 cards on the field, just like in [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi). 

Play **stops** when a player obtains **6 Ribbon cards**. The player is paid **3 shares** by the other player.

> For the purpose of the yaku, all 4 **Willow** ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x) **cards** are considered Ribbon cards. *(In total, 13 of the 48 cards of a standard Hanafuda deck are considered Ribbons)*

**If all players run out of cards** before the yaku is made, the player with the **greater number of card points** is paid **2 shares** by the other player. 
## Card Values
The card values used in this game are completely standard, the same as used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi). Note that captured card values do not matter unless all players run out of cards before anyone has completed the yaku.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|1|24|
# Nana-Tan
**Nana-Tan** (七短, lit. "Seven Ribbons") is a game that is identical to [Roku-Tan](/en/hanafuda/games/roku-tan), except that the yaku consists of **7 Ribbon cards** instead of 6.
