Issoku Yuki [一束行き - いっそくゆき, lit. "One bunch going"] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for **two players**, with very simple rules.

The game has only **one Yaku** : **Decchoko [デッチョコ]**.

# Goal
Reach a total score of 100 points before the other player does.

# Determining the Dealer
The first dealer is determined like in any typical hanafuda game. Each player takes turns being the dealer after every round (The non-dealer of the current round becomes the dealer of the next round).

# Distributing the Initial Cards
The dealer deals 8 cards to each player and 8 cards on the field. 

If 4 cards of the same month appear on the field, it is a **misdeal**, and the dealer reshuffles the deck and deals again. 

# Gameplay
Just like in Bakappana, the round ends when all players run out of cards.

# Scoring
The scoring is **cumulative** (there is no score settlement); every score obtained in each round adds to the total score of the player in the game.

After every round, players count their total captured card points. The round points are tallied, and the total scores are checked.

**If a player reaches a total score of 100 points, the game ends, and that player is declared the winner.**

If nobody reaches 100 points, then another round is played. **The non-dealer of the current round becomes the dealer of the next round.**

> It is also possible to play such that players are keeping track of their total scores throughout the entire game, and the game ends as soon as a player reaches 100 points, even if a round ends prematurely.

# Card Values
The card values are completely standard, the same as used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi).
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|1|24|


# Special Yaku: Decchoko
If you have a **Triplet** (3 cards of the same month) in your hand, and the 4th card of the same month as your Triplet appears on the field, and you manage to **capture all 4 cards**, it is called Decchoko [デッチョコ]. If you manage to do this Yaku, **you take 20 points from the other player *(you gain 20 points, the other player loses 20 points)*.**

> This exchange of points happens **immediately** after all 4 cards have been captured. If a player **reaches 100 points** this way, the **round ends** prematurely, and that player is declared winner.

>It is not attested if you have to **expose your triplet to the other player** first or not. This should probably be agreed upon as a house rule. (NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)
{.is-warning}

Decchoko is similar to Diving [飛び込み - とびこみ, tobikomi] in [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), but with one additional restriction: **You cannot discard any one of the three cards in your triplet until the 4th card of the same month appears on the field.**

> Even if you managed to capture all 4 cards of the same month as the Triplet, It doesn't count as Decchoko if you discarded even one of the 3 cards of your Triplet before the 4th card appears on the field.
