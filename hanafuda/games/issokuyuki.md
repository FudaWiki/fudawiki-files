Issoku Yuki [一束行き - いっそくゆき, lit. "One bunch going"] is a [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) variant for two players, with very simple rules.

The game only **one Special Yaku** : Decchoko


UNDER CONSTRUCTION
# Goal
Reach a total score of 100 points before the other player does.

# Determining the Dealer
The first dealer is determined like in any typical hanafuda game, and **in every round, the other player becomes the next dealer**.

# Distributing the Initial Cards
The dealer deals 8 cards to each player and 8 cards on the field. 

If 4 cards of the same month appear on the field, it is a **misdeal**, and the dealer reshuffles the deck and deals again. 

# Gameplay
Just like in Bakappana, the round ends when all players run out of cards.

# Scoring
The scoring is **cumulative** (there is no score settlement); every score obtained in each round adds to the total score of the player in the game.

As soon as a player reaches a total score of 100 points, the game ends, and that player is declared the winner.

# Card Values
The card values are completely standard, the same as used in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi).
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|9|
|Ribbon|5|10|
|Chaff|1|24|
