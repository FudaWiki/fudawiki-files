**Ino-Shika-Chō** - 猪鹿蝶 [いのしかちょう, lit. "boar-deer-butterfly"] is a luck-based gambling game played with [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). One person acts as the banker, against which any number of players may bet.

Note that the name of this game may also refer to a game similar to [Roppyakken](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken), as well as a yaku appearing in many fishing games.
# Gameplay
The game begins with the banker shuffling the deck and cutting it into four approximately equal packets, which are then placed face-down on the field. Each of the other players then takes their turn betting whatever sum of money they desire on whichever of the four piles of cards they wish. Once all participants have bet, the banker flips over each of the 4 piles, revealing their bottom cards.

Each player wins or loses their bet on a given pile at a rate dependent on which card is revealed:
1. If the card revealed is a **Bright**, the **dealer pays** anyone who bet on that pile **4 times** their wager.
2. If the card revealed is any **Animal except the Boar, Deer, or Butterflies**, the dealer pays out **2 times** any money bet on that pile.
3. If the card revealed is a **Ribbon**, the dealer pays each bettor **the same amount they bet** on that pile.
4. If the card revealed is a **Chaff,** the **dealer collects** any money bet on that pile.
5. If the card revealed is the **Boar, Deer, or Butterflies, the dealer wins all bets on all piles** and collects all money bet!

Once all debts have been settled, the cards are shuffled and the next game may begin.
