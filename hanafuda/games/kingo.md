**Kingo** (きんご) is a hanafuda game for 2 to 7 players. The name derives from the Portuguese word *quinze*, which means 'fifteen'.

Originally the game was played using Tensho Karuta, and later to facilitate easy identification of numbers on the cards, a [one-suited mekurifuda](/en/one-suited-mekurifuda-variants) deck called **"kingo-fuda"**, which may have been the same or similar deck as either Irinokichi or Kinseizan, was used.

Kingo may refer to a wide variety of games where players' card points should not exceed 15. The game described below uses only 40 cards, and can be played using either a **Hanafuda or Kabufuda** deck.

# Equipment
**40** cards of a standard Hanafuda deck is used. Remove all **November** ![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x) and **December** ![Icon for month 12](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_12.png =20x) cards.

A standard **40-card Kabufuda deck** may also be used.

If western playing cards are used, remove all Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Jokers.

In addition to the cards, **Go Stones** are used to keep track of the players' scores.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, oya], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards.

A decision must be made as to how long the game will last - 12 rounds is traditional, though other common options are 6 rounds, 3 rounds, or until all but one player runs out of stones.

Also, a decision must also be made as to how much points a **wager** costs per round. It may be fixed throughout the game, or changed every time a round starts (the decision of which may be done either before or after dealing the cards, usually by the dealer).

## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.

## Dealing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the cards and deals one card to each player's hand, starting from the player to the dealer's right up to the dealer himself/herself. The rest of the cards are put face-down on the table as the draw pile.

## Placing the Wager
Each player then places a wager into the table to form the **pot**, which will be received by the winner of the round.

# Gameplay
Each round, the dealer is the first to play. Turn to play goes counter-clockwise.

During a player's turn, he/she **draws a card** from the draw pile and put it in his/hand to increase the value of their hand.

Afterward, the player can **keep drawing cards** until his/her hand value total **becomes close to 15**, or **pass the turn**  to the next player if he/she thinks the next draw will push his/her hand's value beyond 15.

## Bareta
If the player's hand value **reaches 16 or higher**, his/her hand is called **Bareta** (バレタ, lit. 'busted'). The player **automatically loses the round** and has to pass the turn to the next player immediately. In addition, **the wager he/she must place in the pot during that round is doubled**.

> If all players have Bareta, then the round is voided, all wagers go back to the players, and the cards must be redealt by the same dealer.
{.is-info}

# Showdown
The round ends once all players have passed their turn. All players then reveal their hands.

**The player with the highest hand value (up to 15) wins the round, takes the pot, and becomes the dealer for the next round.**

> If two or more players have the highest hand value, then they split the pot equally. If the pot cannot be split equally, the player nearest to the dealer's right takes the largest share. In both cases, the player nearest to the dealer's right becomes the dealer for the next round.
{.is-info}

# Teyaku
## Shigoro
**Shigoro** (シゴロ) is a 3-card hand consisting of an April ![Icon for month 4](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_4.png =20x) card, a May ![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x) card, and a June ![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x) card, and is worth 15 points.

If it appears during showdown, **the amount in the pot is doubled** (*normal wagers are 2x, Bareta wagers are 4x*).

A player with Shigoro **beats other players with 15-point hands** that are not Shigoro. However, he loses to a player with a Kingo.

## Kingo
**Kingo** (きんご) is a 3-card hand consisting of 3 May ![Icon for month 5](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_5.png =20x) cards, and is also worth 15 points.

If it appears during showdown, **the amount in the pot is tripled** (*normal wagers are 3x, Bareta wagers are 6x*).

A player with Kingo **beats all players regardless of their hand**.

# Kingo: Banking Variant
The game is mostly the same as mentioned above, except that all bettors play against the dealer, instead of each player playing against everyone.

## Setup
### Choosing the Dealer
The method mentioned above may be used to determine the seating order, by checking the sequence of the cards drawn by each player. Once dealer is chosen, all bettors sit against the opposite side of the table as the dealer.

If the dealer represents an establishment- say, when playing at a casino or gambling parlour- then their role will obviously be fixed, though the other players may still use this process to determine their seating order.

### Dealing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the cards and deals **three** cards to each player's hand, starting from the bettor to the dealer's farthest right, counter-clockwise, up to the dealer themselves. The rest of the cards are put face-down on the table as the draw pile.

### Choosing a Card and Discarding the Rest
Each bettor chooses 1 card from their hand that they like, and discards the other 2 cards.

> If all 3 cards are October ![Icon for month 10](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_10.png =20x), you may request for a re-deal.
{.is-info}

The dealer takes all discarded cards and shuffles them into the draw pile.

### Placing the Wager
Each bettor then places their wager onto the table.

## Gameplay
Each round, the **bettor to the dealer's farthest right is the first to play**, and the dealer is last to play. Turn to play goes counter-clockwise.

During a player's turn, he/she **draws a card** from the draw pile and put it in his/hand to increase the value of their hand.

Afterward, the player **must keep drawing cards** until his/her hand value total **becomes close to 15**.

### Tsun
If a player thinks the next draw will push his/her hand's value beyond 15, they may pass the **turn to the next player**. This is called **Tsun** (つん).

A player **cannot pass their turn** unless the value in their hand is **12 or higher**. The only exception is if a player **forms a Teyaku** that they can avail.
> *Some play such that this value is 13 or 11.*
{.is-info}

### Bareta
If a player's hand value **reaches 16 or higher**, his/her hand is called **Bareta** (ばれた), and must reveal their hand immediately. 

That player **automatically loses the round** and has to pass the turn to the next player.

## Showdown
The round ends once all players have passed their turn. All players who do not have bareta already then reveal their hands.

- If the bettor has a **higher value than the dealer**, the **bettor wins** an amount equal to their wager. (*This may be reduced by the rental fee (tera-zen) to the gambling parlor*)
- If the bettor has a **lower value than the dealer**, the **dealer wins** and takes the player's wager.
- If both dealer and bettor have **equal hands worth 15 points**, then it is considered a **tie**. The bettor takes back their wager.
- If both dealer and bettor have **equal hands worth less than 15**, then the **dealer wins**.

## Teyaku
