Saburokku (三六九, lit. “Three-Six-Nine”) is a [Hana-Awase](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for three players, with simple gambling rules. It is thought that the name of the game is in reference to the values of the yaku in the game, which are either 3, 6, or 9 shares.

The game only **features 4 yaku: Four Brights, Seven Ribbons, Poetry Ribbons, and Blue Ribbons. Play stops when one of the yaku are made**, at which point the other players each pay the winner **9** shares for Four Brights, **6** shares for Seven Ribbons, or **3** shares for either of the Ribbon yaku. **If all players run out of cards** before a yaku is made, the card points of each player are calculated, subtracted by the **par score of 88**, and players exchange payments just like in [Hachi-Hachi](https://fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi). Each **5 points is equivalent to one share** (*it is not known how points lower than 5 will be dealt with*).

# Card Values

The card values used in Saburokku are completely standard, the same as used in Hachi-Hachi. Note that captured card values do not matter unless all players run out of cards before anyone has completed a yaku.

| Card Type | Value | Number in Deck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bright | 20  | 5   |
| Animal | 10  | 9   |
| Ribbon | 5   | 10  |
| Chaff  | 1   | 24  |
