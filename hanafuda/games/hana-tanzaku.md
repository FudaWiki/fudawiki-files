**Hana-Tanzaku** (花短冊, Flower Tanzaku) is a [Hana-awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase) variant for 3 players. 

It was introduced as a smartphone app by Hanatanzaku K&S / Kazuyuki Kishida. The author of the app attested the rules of the game to be a traditional local rule passed down to them by their grandparents, and the game was said to be over 100 years old. 

The game originally did not have a name, and the name "Hana-Tanzaku" was only applied by the author of the app, based on the significance of Ribbon cards in the game.

# Gameplay
Each player starts with **2000 points**.

The gameplay and setup is similar to Hana-awase, but with different card point assignments, only three dekiyaku, and a usage of wild card.

> Judging from the app, it seems that **captured cards are not exposed** to all players as is typical of other hanafuda games. The only **exception** are the **captured ribbon cards**, which need to be exposed to all players.

# Wild Card: Rainman

The **Rainman** is used as a wild card in the game.

It can match or be matched with a card of any suit except ![monthicon_11.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x) Willow. Also, it cannot be used to capture 3 cards of the same suit on the field.

At the end of the round, there will be **two cards remaining on the field**, as a result of usage of the Rainman. **Both cards are taken by the player who used the Rainman.**

# Stopping the Round
During a round, if a player captures all **four plain ribbon cards**, then the round is stopped.

**That player is paid 2000 points by each of the other two players, and becomes the dealer for the next round.**

# End of Round and Scoring
If the round wasn't stopped, then the round ends when all players' cards in hand are exhausted. 

Players then check if they captured either Three Poetry Ribbons or Three Blue Ribbons. 

[![Pine With Poetry Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/11.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#poetry-ribbon)[![Plum Blossom with Poetry Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/21.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#poetry-ribbon)[![Cherry Blossom with Poetry Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/31.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon)
[![Peony with Blue Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/61.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony#blue-ribbon)[![Chrysanthemum with Blue Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/91.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum#blue-ribbon)[![Maple with Blue Ribbon](/sheldonchen-cards/101.svg#hanafuda-card =50x)](/en/hanafuda/suits/maple#blue-ribbon)

A player who has formed either set is paid **1000 points** by each of the other two players.

Afterward, players then count all the points from their captured cards, and subtract the sum by the par score of **1100 points** to get the settlement score. Players then exchange points accordingly.

**The player with the highest earnings during a round (including dekiyaku points and card points) becomes the dealer for the next round.**

## Card Points
Card points are non-standard:
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Brights|300|5|
|Bush Warbler, Geese|200|2|
|Other Animals, Poetry Ribbons|100|10|
|Other Ribbons, Yellow Paulownia Chaff|50|8|
|Other Chaff|0|23|

The total card points in the deck is 3300 points. Dividing it by 3 players gives the par score of **1100 points**.
