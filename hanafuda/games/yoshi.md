**Yoshi [ヨシ]** is an [Oicho-kabu](/en/kabufuda/games/oicho-kabu) variant, played in Shikoku island in Japan.

Instead of players having the option to bet on 4 choices on the table, each player only has one hand, and they may bet higher or lower depending on how good the hand is.

Up to 12 players may compete against 1 banker at once per round, for a maximum total of 13 players.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer - 親 [おや, *oya*] (who will serve as the **banker** in the game), deciding the seating arrangement of the other players, and shuffling the deck. Certain ground rules should also be agreed upon before play begins.

## Equipment
Yoshi is played with 40 cards of a *komaru* deck. Remove all jokers from the deck.

Alternatively, this game can also be played using [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) (remove all willow and paulownia cards), or western playing cards (remove all jokers and court cards).

In addition to the deck, counters such as chips to represent points will be highly useful. Using different colours of chips for each player will help with tracking bets.

## Ground Rules
Before play begins, the group should agree on the following:

- What should happen in the event of a tie between a player and the dealer. There are two options: Either the result is a draw and the player's bet is returned, or the dealer wins.
- The minimum bet that a player could wager per round.
- The maximum total bet. This is a limit on the amount of points that can be wagered per round- the sum of all bets from all players cannot exceed it, and once it is reached, no further bets can be placed.

## Choosing the Dealer and Seating
To begin, each player draws a card from the deck. The player with the lowest number becomes the dealer, and the remaining players seat themselves in order anti-clockwise around the table- the second-lowest number sits to the right of the dealer, third-lowest to the right of them, and so on. Since play begins with the dealer and progresses anti-clockwise, there is a distinct advantage to sitting close to the dealer's right.

If the dealer represents an establishment- say, when playing at a casino or gambling parlour- then their role will obviously be fixed, though the other players may still use this process to determine their seating order.

In the event of a tie, the players in question should draw a second card and compare again.

> When playing with a hanafuda deck, the ranks of the cards can be used to break ties in the usual manner- Brights beat Animals, which beat Ribbons, which beat Chaff.<br><br>With a standard 52-card deck, suits could be used to break ties instead.

# Gameplay
Over the course of the round, each player attempts to form a hand whose total value is as close as possible to 9. Totals that go over 9 'wrap around' by discarding the tens digit. So 10 is equivalent to 0, 11 is equivalent to 1, and so on, much like Baccarat. Similar to other banking games, the players are not competing against each other, but are only aiming to beat the dealer.

## The First Card
The dealer shuffles the deck and deals one card face up to each player, and then one card face up to themself. Each of these cards forms the basis of the hand of the player who received them.

Then, starting from the right of the dealer and working anti-clockwise, the players take turns to bet on these hands. Each player may choose the amount they bet on their hand (as long as it's within the limits agreed upon in the ground rules). They signal their bets by placing the appropriate number of chips on top of each card.

## The Second (and Third) Card
After all players have placed their bets, each player, starting from the right of the dealer and working anti-clockwise, receives a second card from the dealer.

Upon receiving the second card, each player may:
- **request the dealer for a third card**. The dealer then gives that player a third card, then proceeds to give the next player their second card.
- **declare "*yoshi!*"**, if the player is satisfied with the two cards in their hand. The dealer then proceeds to give the next player their second card.

## The Showdown
Finally, the dealer does the same to themself: They deal a second card to themself, and they may either deal a third card or declare "*yoshi!*".

Now that all players' cards are revealed, the dealer's hand is then compared with each of the players' hands.

- If the dealer's hand totals **greater** than a player's hand, then the dealer wins; they take for themselves any bets placed on that hand by that player.
- If the dealer's hand totals **less** than a player's hand, then the player wins. The player who bet on that hand wins an amount equal to their bet, in addition to having their bet returned to them, for a total payout of 2:1.
- If the dealer's hand and a player's hand are **equal** in value, then this is a draw, and whichever rule the players agreed upon beforehand is applied. Either the dealer wins, or all bets on that hand are annulled and returned to the player.

This comparison is performed independently for each of the players' hands- it is entirely possible for the dealer to win against some players while losing against others.

One special Yaku is in effect here:
- **Dealer 9 and 1** [九一 - くっぴん, *kuppin*]: If the dealer's first card is a 9 and their second is a 1, then the dealer automatically wins against all players.

# Additional Rounds
No particular setup is given for playing additional rounds. When playing at a casino or parlour, the dealer will remain the dealer, though the players may cycle their seating positions.

In casual games, the dealer may either remain fixed, or lose their role whenever their hand loses against every hand on the table. In this case, the player to their right becomes the next dealer.
