**Jū Mai** is a 2-player [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase)-style game with no yaku, making it more or less a variant form of [bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana). It uses a different number of cards dealt to the field than most 2-player fishing games, and uses slightly different values for the different [types](/en/hanafuda/types) of cards from most games. The first player to reach a score 30 points higher than their opponent's is the winner.

# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. Any house rules should also be established to keep gameplay smooth and fair.
## Choosing the Dealer
No method is stipulated for choosing the dealer. A hanafuda-specific method involves each player drawing a card from the deck, and the player with the earliest month becomes the dealer. In the event of a tie, the highest-ranked card within the month is considered the earliest. If there is still a tie, then the players re-draw.

In subsequent rounds, the dealer position may alternate between players.
## Distributing the Cards
The dealer shuffles the deck and passes out **10 cards face-down to each player**, which will become their hands, and **10 cards face-up on the field**. The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the field, and will act as a draw pile for the round.
# Gameplay
In each round, **the dealer is the first to play**, with players taking alternating turns. General gameplay is identical to that of [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana)
## Turns
On their turn, a player chooses a single card from their hand and plays it to the table.

* **If it belongs to the same month as another card on the table**, then the cards *match*, and this matching pair is moved to the player's score pile.
* **If the played card matches with two cards on the table**, then the player may choose which one they capture.
* **If the played card matches *three* cards on the table**, then all three are captured along with the played card (this is to prevent cards from becoming 'stuck' on the table and unable to be captured). To help in recognising this case, three cards of the same month on the table are often collected into a small pile at the beginning of the round.
* **If the played card does not match any card**, then it remains on the table, and may subsequently be captured by other played cards.

After a card has been played from their hand, the player takes the top card of the draw pile, turns it face-up, and immediately plays it to the table in the same fashion, pairing and capturing if possible.

After both cards have been played - one from the player's hand, and one from the draw pile - the turn ends, and the next player takes their turn.

> Each player's score pile should **be kept face-up and laid out on the table**, so that its contents are visible to all players. Ideally, the cards should also be arranged by [type](/en/hanafuda/types) to make assessing the game state easier.

## End of Round and Scoring
The round ends when both players have fully exhausted all cards in their hands; at this point, every card in the deck should have been captured by one player or the other.

**Note that the draw pile will run out before players have played their last card**; on each player's final turn, they only play the card from their hand since the deck has already been emptied.

Each player then calculates their socres according to the following chart.

|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|[Brights](/en/hanafuda/types/brights)|30|5|
|[Animals](/en/hanafuda/types/animals)|10|9|
|[Ribbons](/en/hanafuda/types/ribbons)|5|10|
|[Chaff](/en/hanafuda/types/chaff)|0|24|
Thus there are 290 points distributed throughout a complete deck.

**If one player's score exceeds the other's by at least 30 points at the end of a round, that player wins the game.** If this is not achieved in a single round, the difference in their scores is carried over across as many rounds as necessary until one player has met the victory condition.
