Chunchun (チュンチュン) is a Hanafuda game for three to seven players, played in the Okayama prefecture in the San'yo region of Japan. It is a simplified version of [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi).

> The game is for up to 7 players, but only 3 players can participate in the round. It is probable that the same or similar Drop-out system used in Hachi-hachi is also used in this game. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**

# Teyaku

|Value (in *kan*)|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---|
|<h2 align="left">Group A: Set Teyaku</h2>|||
|4|**Three Pairs**<br/>喰付 [くっつき, *kuttsuki*] (lit. *sticky?*)|Three pairs of cards- a pair being two cards from the same month.|

|<h2 align="left">Group B: Chaff Teyaku</h2><br>**Note**: For the purposes of these teyaku, *all* [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards are considered Chaff, as opposed to their usual value. In particular, the Willow Ribbon is not considered a Ribbon.|||
|3|**One Ribbon**<br/>短一 [たんいち, *tan'ichi*]|One Ribbon card, six Chaff.|
|3|**One Animal**<br/>十一 [といち, *toichi*]|One Animal card, six Chaff.|
|3|**One Bright**<br/>光一 [ぴかいち, *pikaichi*]|One Bright card, six Chaff.|
|4|**Empty Hand**<br/>空素 [からす, *karasu*]|Seven Chaff cards.|

The teyaku within each group are mutually exclusive, meaning that **each player scores for their single most valuable teyaku in each of Groups A and B.** In order to claim their *teyaku*, a player must reveal all the relevant cards from their hand: 
* For teyaku in Group A, show all cards that are part of the combination. 
* For teyaku in Group B, only the Chaff cards need to be shown.

# Dekiyaku

> The round ends as soon as a Dekiyaku is formed.

# Card Values
If no player has managed to form any *dekiyaku*, then the players count the point values of the cards in their score pile to determine the winner.

The card values used in Chunchun are slightly different from those used in Hachi-Hachi. The **Bush Warbler** and the **Deer*** are considered **Brights** instead of Animals, the **Yellow Paulownia Chaff** is considered an **Animal**, and all other Chaffs are worth **0 points**.

| Card Type | Value | Number in Deck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bright | 20  | 7   |
| Animal | 10  | 8  |
| Ribbon | 5   | 10  |
| Chaff | 0   | 24  |

*Some people use the **Boar** as a Bright instead of the Deer.

> The card scores are calculated in the same manner as in Hachi-hachi, except the **par value is 90 points**.

# Special Yaku
Before scoring is calculated, however, there are three special Yaku that need to be checked for. These unique situations **cancel all other forms of scoring**, including *teyaku* payments.

|Case|Description|
|:---|:---|
|***All Eights***|*All Eights* [総八 - そうはち, *souhachi*] occurs when every player has captured exactly **90** card points. In this situation, the dealer claims 10 *kan* from each opponent. The dealer is the winner of the round, and remains dealer for the next.|
|***Double Eights***|*Double Eights* [二八 - ふたはち, *futahachi*] occurs when a single player scores at least 80 above the par value, i.e. when they capture **170** or more total card points. This player takes 10 *kan* from each opponent, plus 1 additional *kan* for every point above 170. This player is the winner of the round, and becomes the dealer for the next.|
|***Sixteen Chaff***|As its name implies, *Sixteen Chaff* [素十六 - すじゅうろく, *sujuuroku*] occurs when a player has managed to capture at least 16 Chaff cards (for this purpose, all [![Icon for month 11](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_11.png =20x)Willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) cards count as Chaff). This player takes 12 *kan* from each opponent, plus an additional 2 *kan* for every Chaff card in excess of 16. They will be the winner of the round, and become the dealer for the next.|

> If the *Sixteen Chaff* situation occurs together with either *All Eights* or *Double Eights*, then the latter take precedence.
