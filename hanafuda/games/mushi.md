Mushi (Insect) is a 2-player hanafuda game played either with a 40-card [Mushi-bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) deck, which lacks the [Peony](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony) and [Bush Clover](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover) suits, or a standard deck with those suits simply removed. Some of its characteristic features are the use of the [Lightning](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) card as a wild card, relatively few yaku, and zero-sum scoring.
# Setup
Game setup involves choosing a dealer [親 - おや, *oya*], shuffling the deck, and distributing the initial cards. A decision must also be made as to how long the game will last - common options are 6 rounds, 12 rounds, or until some target score has been met by one player. Any other house rules should also be established at this point in order to keep gameplay smooth and fair.
## Choosing the Dealer
There is no required method for selecting who is the first dealer, though a typical method in hanafuda games is to shuffle the deck and have both players draw one card each. The player who drew a suit for the earliest month becomes the dealer. If both players drew from the same suit, the player drawing the higher point card becomes the dealer. In cases where there is a tie, this process can be repeated.
## Distributing the Initial Cards
Eight cards are distributed to each player, and eight to the table. While there is no required method for this distribution, it is common for the dealer to give four to their opponent, four to the table, four to themself, and then repeat.

If 4 cards of the same suit are dealt to the field at the beginning of a round, generally a misdeal is declared and the same dealer shuffles and distributes cards once more. The same may be true in the case that that 4 pairs of different suits are dealt to the field.
# Wild Card
In Mushi, the Lightning card can be used to capture any other individual card except another Willow. If it is dealt to the field at game setup, it will be captured by the first non-Willow card drawn from the deck. If, however, the Lightning card is the last to be drawn from the deck, it captures all remaining cards in play.

Due to the usage of a wild card, most rounds will end with two unpaired cards - one Willow, and one that matches suit with the card captured by the Lightning. In this case, the last Willow will be added to the score of the player who captured the other two non-wild Willows, and the remaining card is added to the score of the player who used the Lightning.
# Card Values
The values of each card in Mushi are the same as in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), though the reduction in suits leads to different distributions of those card types.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|7|
|Ribbon|5|8|
|Chaff|1|20|
This means that the total number of card points to be split by the players each round is 230. To calculate one's initial score for a given round, add up the points for all cards captured, and subtract 115.
# Yaku
There are typically only 4 yaku used in Mushi. Players earn points for each of these that they capture, and subtract the same number of points from their opponents' score.
|Value|Name of Yaku|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|30|Five Brights - 五光 [ごうこ, *gōko*]|All five Bright cards.|
|25|Three Brights - 三光 [さんこ, *sanko*]|[The Crane](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine), [Bush Warbler](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom), and [Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom). Not to be confused with the yaku of the same name in [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi).|
|10|Wisteria Stripe - 藤シマ [ふじしま, *fujishima*]|All 4 [Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria) cards.|
|10|Paulownia Stripe - 桐シマ [きりしま, *kirishima*]|All 4 [Paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) cards.|
