Mushi (Insect) is a 2-player hanafuda game played either with a 40-card [Mushi-bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) deck, which lacks the Peony and Bush Clover suits, or a standard deck with those suits simply removed. Some of its characteristic features are the use of the Lightning card as a wild card, relatively few yaku, and zero-sum scoring.

# Card Values
The values of each card in Mushi are the same as in [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), though the reduction in suits leads to different distributions of those card types.
|Card Type|Value|Number in Deck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bright|20|5|
|Animal|10|7|
|Ribbon|5|8|
|Chaff|1|20|
This means that the total number of card points to be split by the players each round is 230. To calculate one's initial score for a given round, add up the points for all cards captured, and subtract 115.
# Yaku
There are typically only 4 yaku used in Mushi. Players earn points for each of these that they capture, and subtract the same number of points from their opponents' score.
|Value|Name of Yaku|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|30|Five Brights - 五光 [ごうこ, *gōko*]|All five Bright cards.|
|25|Three Brights - 三光 [さんこ, *sanko*]|The Crane (Pine Bright), Bush Warbler (Plum Blossom Animal), and Curtain (Cherry Blossom Bright).|
|10|Wisteria Month - 藤シマ [ふじしま, *fujishima*]|All 4 Wisteria cards.|
|10|Paulownia Month - 桐シマ [きりしま, *kirishima*]|All 4 Paulownia cards.|
