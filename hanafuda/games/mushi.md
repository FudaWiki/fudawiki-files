# Overview
Mushi (Insect) is a 2-player hanafuda game played either with a 40-card [Mushi-bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) deck, which lacks the Peony and Bush Clover suits, or a standard deck with those suits simply removed. Some of its characteristic features are the use of the Lightning card as a wild card, relatively few yaku, and zero-sum scoring.
