UNDER CONSTRUCTION

1. Deal three cards face down in front of you, starting with the parent. 
2. Parent "guesses" what the cards are. Of course, at first they have no information, so they take a guess. You can say "1, 2, and 3" as numbers, or you can say "pine, plum, and cherry blossoms" as flowers. You can also say "pine, plum, and cherry blossoms" in terms of flowers.
3. the bidding is done counterclockwise from the parent. In "28 Kinds of Hanafuda Games," the bidding heights are 3, 7, 11, 12, 16, 22, 26, 30, 31, 35, 41, 45, and 50, with 50 as the upper limit, and the next bidder goes back to 3. In other words, the first parent to compete says "3" and puts three chips into the pot. The next person chips in with "7".
Note: The actual game I was playing was 1,2,3,4,5.... I don't think there was an upper limit.
4. the bidding ends when Biki declares a stop after competing.
Note 4-1: "28 Hanafuda Games" says that the player can pay 1 and pass. The parent does not lose the right to do so, but only twice per game.
Note 4-2: Some rules allow a player to pass before the player declares a stop. In this case, the player loses his or her parent in the next turn.
5. When the bidding is over, the player's parent turns over the three face-down cards and judges whether or not his or her "guess" is correct.
6. 6-1: If the prediction is correct, the player receives the chips accumulated in the pot. In this case, the first player receives 20% of the pot.
6-2: If the prediction is not correct, the parent moves to the next player, and the process is repeated from 1 to 5.
6-3: If there is a surplus of chips due to the number of players, and if the player does not win until the end of the hand, the player who won the pot receives 20% of the chips in the pot, and the rest is carried over to the next round.
Note: The 20% of the pot is not a tera, but more like a first round bailout. 
7. If the player's prediction does not come true, the cards are turned over to the table and become information for the next game.

Yatchaba [やっちゃば] is a guessing game played using Hanafuda cards.

It is designed to be played by 4 to 6 players, although it is possible for more or less people to participate in the game.

# Equipment
48 cards of a standard hanafuda deck are used.

It is also possible to play using other kinds of cards, such as western playing cards (remove the 10's from the deck), or mekurifuda decks with 12 numbers on them.

Chips are used for keeping track of scores.

# Gameplay
## Setup
First, determine the dealer and seating order using any method you prefer.

The dealer shuffles the deck and places **three face-down cards on the table**. The rest of the deck is placed face-down near the dealer.

During one game, each player gets a chance to be the "guesser" in the game, starting with the dealer (first guesser) counterclockwise.

## First Round
The dealer **tries to guess what months the 3 face-down cards on the table are**. 

After the dealer declares their guess, each player, starting with the dealer counter-clockwise until the player to the dealer's left, **places an amount of chips into the pot**, with **each player placing a higher amount than the previous player**.

*For example, in a 4-player game, the dealer places 1 chip into the pot, the 2nd  player places 2 chips, the 3rd player places 3 chips, and the 4th player places 4 chips.*

>In the book "28 Kinds of Hanafuda Games" each player must follow a specific order of amounts to be placed on the pot: 3, 7, 11, 12, 16, 22, 26, 30, 31, 35, 41, 45, and 50. 50 is the maximum amount; if a player places 50 chips, the next player places 50 chips as well. However, in practice, this is not followed.
{.is-info}


Once the **player to the dealer's left ("last player")** has placed their chips into the pot, that player has the choice whether to **continue** the sequence of placing chips or to **stop it**.

If the last player chooses to continue, then all players, starting with the dealer and ending with the last player, place even more increasing amounts of chips into the pot. Then the last player chooses again whether to continue or stop.

*For example, in a 4-player game, the 4th player chooses to continue. The dealer then places 5 chips into the pot, the 2nd player places 6 chips, the 3rd player places 7 chips, and the 4th player places 8 chips, then the 4th player chooses again whether to continue or stop. If the 4th player chooses to continue, then the dealer places 9 chips, the 2nd player places 10 chips...*

> Optional Rule: After the last player declares to continue, each player may declare to "pass" from placing any further chips, by placing 1 chip into the pot.
{.is-info}

However, if the last player chooses to stop, then the dealer reveals the 3 face-down cards by flipping them face-up. The dealer then checks if their prediction is correct.

- If the dealer **guesses all 3 months correctly** *(order of the cards do not matter as long as all months guessed appear on the table)*, then the **dealer wins. They take 100% of the pot**.
- If the dealer fails to guess at least 1 month correctly
