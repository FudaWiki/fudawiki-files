***Hwatu*** (Hanja: 花鬪, Hangul: 화투, lit. "flower battle") is the Korean version of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). 

The *Hwatu* deck structure is generally very similar to its Japanese counterpart, but with a few notable tendencies. First, these cards are generally made of thick plastic rather than the backpapered board. In addition, the Bright cards usually feature a circled *Hikari/Gwang* symbol to help distinguish them from the Animals, and the Willow and Paulownia suits are considered to be reversed in order from the Japanese standard month arrangement.

# History of Hwatu
In 1876, A treaty was made between the Empire of Japan and the Kingdom of Joseon (Korea), which opened Korea to Japanese Trade.

It is said that around that time, Hanafuda from Japan was introduced to the Koreans by Japanese merchants from Tsushima Island. These merchants made settlements in Korea, and the cards spread as many Japanese settlers played hanafuda there. Originally, a different type of card deck called *Tujeon* ('battle cards') was being played in Korea, and so the Koreans refered to Hanafuda as *Hwatu*, a combination of "*Hwa*", the Korean word for flower, and "*Tu*" ('battle') from *Tujeon*. However, as *Hwatu* spread, *Tujeon* fell out of use, and some games originally played with *Tujeon* cards were adapted to be played using hanafuda instead.

Then in 1910, Japan colonized Korea. During that time, *Hwatu* was already widely spread to the common people, and a handful of [karuta](/en/karuta) manufacturers in Japan were exporting to Korea at the time. Early Japanese records during that time show that demand for *Hwatu* in Korea was higher than that in Japan. Folk songs based on the months of Hwatu called "*Hwatutaryeong*" were made during the colonial period.

After World War II ended in 1945, Korea became liberated from Japanese rule, and a strong anti-Japanese sentiment among the people caused a desire to erase "*Waesaek*" ('Japanese aesthetic')- the remnants of Japanese colonialism in Korea- from the lifestyle of Korean people. Due to its Japanese origins, *Hwatu* definitely belongs in this category, and it fell out of use for a brief period of time before it gradually started being played again.

In South Korea, the government banned *Hwatu* due to its Japanese aesthetic. Because of this, attempts to change the design of *Hwatu* into a fully Korean design were proposed (there is an example in a 1956 newspaper advertisement), but these attempts were unsuccessful.

The year of change of material of *Hwatu* from paper to plastic is disputed. It is said that Hwatu made of plastic was first introduced during the 1950's after attempts to change the design of the illustrations failed. There is also a theory that argues against this, saying that as a country ravaged by war, South Korea during the 1950's had a petrochemical company capable of producing only the main needs of the country, and that the change in material of Hwatu instead happened sometime in the 1970's, when South Korea was experiencing a period of rapid economic growth. The plastic *Hwatu* proved to be more practical than paper *Hwatu*, and the popularity of the cards in South Korea rose again. 

Nowadays, Hwatu is considered a Korean folk pastime, being used to play traditional games and also for fortune telling (*Hwatujeom*). However, like its Japanese counterpart, it has a bad reputation of being an instrument for gambling.

It is also interesting to note that there were times when Korean-made *Hwatu* was exported to Japan, and also times when Japanese companies outsourced their hanafuda to Korean manufacturers. In the 2010's, Daiso, a budget store in Japan, sold plastic hanafuda. While these hanafuda contained designs resembling the Japanese hanafuda rather than Korean *Hwatu*, they were made in South Korea.

# Material
Originally, *Hwatu* are made of paper, just like Japanese hanafuda, but the material has since been replaced with plastic.

![hwatu_edge.jpg](/hwatu_edge.jpg =250x)

Typically, modern *Hwatu* are made of **3 layers of plastic laminated together** and cut into card-size pieces.
- The front layer is very thin and contains the print design for the cards.
- The core layer makes up the majority of the bulk of each *Hwatu* card. The plastic material of this layer is usually mixed with stone powder, which gives the cards weight.
- The back layer is also thin and is usually in one color (usually red). It also contains dimples or some kind of texture on it. While people say the texture prevents the cards from slipping, its actual effect is to prevent cards from sticking to each other.

![hwatu_back.jpg](/hwatu_back.jpg =150x)

# Illustration designs
A typical modern *Hwatu* deck contains designs that evolved from the Japanese Hachi-hachi-bana pattern, specifically that of [Nihon Karuta](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nihonkaruta), a Hanafuda manufacturer who frequently exported cards to Korea in the past. 

## The Red Goose

![hwatu_august_tane.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_august_tane.png =80x)

The most telling signs are the colorization of the Geese card, where one of the geese is colored red, while the others are orange (or yellow). This element existed in most Nihon Karuta Hachi-hachi-bana decks (and some [Oishi Tengudo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/oishitengudo) decks as well), at a time when most hanafuda manufacturers colored the geese all orange (with red heads).

## Trademark on the Full Moon

![hwatu_august_hikari.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_august_hikari.png =80x)

The practice of putting a manufacturer's trademark on the Full Moon card evolved from Nihon Karuta's practice of putting an image of a rabbit pounding mochi on the Full Moon card.


## Gwang [光 or 광]

![hwatu_january_hikari.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_january_hikari.png =80x)![hwatu_march_hikari.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_march_hikari.png =80x)![hwatu_august_hikari.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_august_hikari.png =80x)![hwatu_november_hikari.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_november_hikari.png =80x)![hwatu_december_hikari.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_december_hikari.png =80x)


The practice of marking each bright card with a circle containing the character '光' (*hikari*) (which makes it easier to distinguish Bright cards from Animal cards) came from special Hachi-hachi-bana patterns from Japan which also had these marks. Many hanafuda manufacturers offered such types of hanafuda at the time, or some variation of it ([Nintendo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo)'s deck featured a circled '福' (*fuku*) instead of '光'). 

Both Nihon Karuta and Oishi Tengudo claim to have invented the use of circled '光' to mark bright cards.

## Red Paulownia Chaff

![hwatu_november_kasu_2.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_november_kasu_2.png =80x)

Typically in *Hwatu*, the colored Paulownia Chaff is red. 

In Japanese hanafuda, the typical color is yellow, but there do exist decks that have a red Paulownia Chaff. The Nihon Karuta deck in particular has a pink Paulownia Chaff. 

## Design Changes from Japanese Hanafuda
While attempts to popularize a radical change in design of *Hwatu* during the 1950's were unsuccessful, some changes actually made its way to the design of *Hwatu* as it is known today.

### Korean writings on the Ribbons
All poetry ribbons and blue ribbons of a *Hwatu* deck have Korean writing on them, which indicate their color (and the name of the Yaku that they form). Other red ribbons have no writing on them.

![hwatu_january_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_january_tanzaku.png =80x)![hwatu_february_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_february_tanzaku.png =80x)![hwatu_march_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_march_tanzaku.png =80x)
The **poetry ribbons** have **"*Hongdan*"** [홍단, 'red ribbons'] written on them.

![hwatu_june_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_june_tanzaku.png =80x)![hwatu_september_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_september_tanzaku.png =80x)![hwatu_october_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_october_tanzaku.png =80x)
The **blue ribbons** have **"*Cheongdan*"** [청단, 'blue ribbons'] written on them.

This differs from Japanese hanafuda decks, which have the writing "*Aka-yoroshi*" on the Pine and Plum Blossom Ribbons, and "*Miyoshino*" on the Cherry Blossom Ribbon, both written in Japanese hiragana (with an archaic character for '*ka*' in "*Aka-yoroshi*"). Japanese hanafuda do not have any writing on the blue ribbons.

### Color of Blue Ribbons

![hwatu_june_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_june_tanzaku.png =80x)![hwatu_september_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_september_tanzaku.png =80x)![hwatu_october_tanzaku.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_october_tanzaku.png =80x)

The **blue ribbons** of a *Hwatu* deck are **actually colored blue**, unlike those of Japanese hanafuda, which are typically either purple or black in color. This must have been a cost-cutting method by reducing the number of colors of inks used.

### The Rainman
![hwatu_december_hikari.png](/suryongfiles/hwatu_december_hikari.png =80x)
The image of Ono no Michikaze on the Rainman card had his *Kanmuri* (a Heian-period Japanese cap) replaced with a ***Beonggeoji*** (a Korean round hat), to erase any association with the Japanese calligrapher.

# Deck Composition
Just like Japanese hanafuda, *Hwatu* consists of 48 cards, which consist of 12 suits of 4 cards each.

## Suits and Month arrangement

All *Hwatu* games use the [**Korean month sequence**](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits); the Willow and Paulownia suits are reversed in order from the Japanese standard month sequence.

It is not known how and when the **Wisteria** and **Iris** suits started to be identified by the Koreans as **Black Bush Clover** and **Orchid** respectively, but folk songs based on *Hwatu* during the period of Japanese rule mention Black Bush Clover and Orchid, so it must have happened sometime during or before the Japanese colonial period. 

Also, because of this, most **Wisteria** cards are typically positioned **upside down**, to further cement the impression that they are not hanging Wisteria flowers but Black Bush Clovers growing up from the ground. (In a new Hwatu deck *all* Wisteria cards are typically positioned upside down, but Korean people usually orient the Cuckoo card -- and only the Cuckoo card -- rightside up.)

## Jokers
Aside from the basic 48 cards, there are usually additional Joker cards included in the deck (around 6 or less). They contain different prints and have different names and rules for them, depending on the manufacturer.

These cards are optional, and are typically used sparingly in fishing games such as Go-Stop.

### Examples of Joker Names and Rules

**Note:** Typically Jokers without any names on them are counted as 1 chaff.
