**Hwatu** (화투, lit. "flower battle") is the Korean version of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). 

The hwatu deck structure is generally very similar to its Japanese counterpart, but with a few notable tendencies. First, these cards are generally made of thick plastic rather than the backpapered board. In addition, the Bright cards usually feature a circled Hikari/Gwang symbol to help distinguish them from the Animals, and the Willow and Paulownia suits are considered to be reversed in order from the Japanese standard month arrangement.

# Material
Originally, Hwatu are made of paper, just like Japanese hanafuda, but it has since been replaced with plastic Hwatu.

It is said that Hwatu made of plastic was first introduced during the 1950's, and enjoyed great popularity over paper-made Hwatu that by the 1970's, all Hwatu being manufactured are made of plastic.

Typically, modern Hwatu are made of 3 layers of plastic laminated together and cut into card-size pieces.
- The front layer is very thin and contains the print design for the cards.
- The core layer makes up the majority of the bulk of each Hwatu card. The plastic material of this layer is usually mixed with stone powder, which gives the cards weight.
- The back layer is also thin and is usually in one color (usually red). It also contains dimples or some kind of texture on it. While people say the texture prevents the cards from slipping, its actual effect is to prevent cards from sticking to each other.


# Illustration designs
A typical Hwatu deck contains designs that evolved from the Japanese Hachi-hachi-bana pattern, specifically that of [Nihon Karuta](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nihonkaruta), a Hanafuda manufacturer who frequently exported cards to Korea in the past. 

The most telling signs are the colorization of the Geese card, where one of the geese is colored red, while the others are orange (or yellow). This element existed in most Nihon Karuta Hachi-hachi-bana decks (and some [Oishi Tengudo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/oishitengudo) decks as well), at a time when most hanafuda manufacturers colored the geese all orange (with red heads).

Next, the practice of putting a manufacturer's trademark on the Full Moon card evolved from Nihon Karuta's practice of putting an image of a rabbit pounding mochi on the Full Moon card.


## Gwang [光 or 광]

# Deck Composition
Just like Japanese hanafuda, Hwatu consists of 48 cards, which consist of 12 suits of 4 cards each.

## Suits and Month arrangement

**NOTE**: All Hwatu games use the [Korean month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) (i.e. the Willow and Paulownia suits are reversed in order from the standard month sequence).

## Jokers
Aside from the basic 48 cards, there are usually additional Joker cards included in the deck (around 6 or less). They contain different prints and have different names and rules for them, depending on the manufacturer.

These cards are optional, and are typically used sparingly in fishing games such as Go-Stop.

### Examples of Joker Names and Rules
- 투피 (two-pi): treated as 2 chaffs
- 쓰리피 (three-pi): treated as 3 chaffs
- 쎄븐피 (seven-pi): gains 7 points from each player, then removes this card from the round and draw another card (similar to a variant which a player who captures Boar - July Animal - steals money from other players regardless of the round result)
- 플러스피 (plus-pi): * Actually there are 2 jokers with the same name on the web. One with x2 doubles the score, and one without x2 is treated as 1 chaff
- 보스피 (boss-pi): steals 1 chaff from each player
- 빠꾸피 (bbakku-pi) [lit. back chaff]: gives 1 chaff to each player (yes, this one is a joker with penalty)
- 비쌍피 (bissang-pi) [lit. rain double chaff]: an additional Lightning Storm card. When this card is used, remove regular Lightning Storm card or Willow Ribbon card (there is also a Paulownia double chaff version)
- 보너스패 (bonus-pae): an alternative name of jokers in Hwatu
- 패보여주기 (paeboyeojugi) [lit. show your hand]: show your hand (this one is also a joker with penalty. 'for 3 seconds' is written above the center)
- 삼원조우카 (samwon-joker) [lit. joker for three Won]: can be used to complete a yaku in place of the missing card when you have exactly 2 cards of a three-card yaku
- 면광패 (myeongwang-pae) [lit. a card avoids bright penalty]: avoids x2 penalty when you don't have a Bright and an opponent wins with a Bright yaku
- 축하패 (chookha-pae) [lit. a card of celebration]: it depends. One example mentions 'x2 when you win after capturing this card'
- 육광 (yukgwang) [lit. sixth gwang]: probably treated as an additional Bright
- 따블패 (double-pae): x2 when you win after capturing this card
- 유턴피 (U-turn-pi): capturing player gives 1 chaff to each player. If another player becomes able to declare a Go or Stop due to this card, the player must wait 1 turn before declaring whether to Go or stop.
