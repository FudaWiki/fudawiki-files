**Hwatu** (화투, lit. "flower battle") is the Korean version of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). 

The hwatu deck structure is generally very similar to its Japanese counterpart, but with a few notable tendencies. First, these cards are generally made of thick plastic rather than the backpapered board. In addition, the Bright cards usually feature a circled Hikari/Gwang symbol to help distinguish them from the Animals, and the Willow and Paulownia suits are considered to be reversed in order from the Japanese standard month arrangement.

## Suits and Month arrangement
**NOTE**: All Hwatu games use the [Korean month sequence](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits) (i.e. the Willow and Paulownia suits are reversed in order from the standard month sequence).

## Jokers
Aside from the basic 48 cards, there are usually additional Joker cards included in the deck (around 6 or less). They contain different prints and have different names and rules for them, depending on the manufacturer.
### Examples of Joker Names and Rules
- 투피 (two-pi): treated as 2 chaffs
- 쓰리피 (three-pi): treated as 3 chaffs
- 쎄븐피 (seven-pi): gains 7 points from each player, then removes this card from the round and draw another card (similar to a variant which a player who captures Boar - July Animal - steals money from other players regardless of the round result)
- 플러스피 (plus-pi): * Actually there are 2 jokers with the same name on the web. One with x2 doubles the score, and one without x2 is treated as 1 chaff
- 보스피 (boss-pi): steals 1 chaff from each player
- 빠꾸피 (bbakku-pi) [lit. back chaff]: gives 1 chaff to each player (yes, this one is a joker with penalty)
- 비쌍피 (bissang-pi) [lit. rain double chaff]: an additional Lightning Storm card. When this card is used, remove regular Lightning Storm card or Willow Ribbon card (there is also a Paulownia double chaff version)
- 보너스패 (bonus-pae): an alternative name of jokers in Hwatu
- 패보여주기 (paeboyeojugi) [lit. show your hand]: show your hand (this one is also a joker with penalty. 'for 3 seconds' is written above the center)
- 삼원조우카 (samwon-joker) [lit. joker for three Won]: can be used to complete a yaku in place of the missing card when you have exactly 2 cards of a three-card yaku
- 면광패 (myeongwang-pae) [lit. a card avoids bright penalty]: avoids x2 penalty when you don't have a Bright and an opponent wins with a Bright yaku
- 축하패 (chookha-pae) [lit. a card of celebration]: it depends, but the one I found with an additional text (with a flying soccer ball) says 'x2 when you win after capturing this card'
- 육광 (yukgwang) [lit. sixth gwang]: probably treated as an additional Bright
- 따블패 (double-pae): x2 when you win after capturing this card
- 유턴피 (U-turn-pi): capturing player gives 1 chaff to each player. If another player becomes able to declare a Go or Stop due to this card, the player must wait 1 turn before declaring whether to Go or stop.
