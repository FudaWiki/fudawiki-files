Hwatu (lit. "flower battle") are the Korean version of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda). The hwatu deck structure is generally very similar to its Japanese counterpart, but with a few notable tendencies. First, these cards are generally made of thick plastic rather than the backpapered board. In addition, the Bright cards usually feature a circled Hikari/Gwang symbol to help distinguish them from the Animals, and the Willow and Paulownia suits are considered to be reversed in order from the Japanese month arrangement.
