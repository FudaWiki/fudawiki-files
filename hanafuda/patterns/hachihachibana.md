The Hachi-hachi-bana [八八花 - はちはちばな] design, lit. “Eighty-Eight Flowers,” is the standard pattern for today's hanafuda. These decks feature Ono No Michikaze with an open umbrella and a frog on the Willow Bright card, and a red and grey, more abstract design on the Willow Chaff. This standard deck design has few visual frills and its cards are usually devoid of any metallic overprinting.
