Mushi-Bana (虫花 - むしばな, lit. “insect flowers”) refers to a particular style of hanafuda decks that lacks the Peony and Bush Clover suits, thus containing only 40 rather than the usual 48 cards. In most other respects, this pattern tends to be very similar to the standard Hachi-Hachi-Bana design. It is said to have originated in the Kansai region of Japan, near Osaka, and is used to play the fishing-type game Mushi, which is popular in that area.
