<p>The Hachi-hachi-bana design, which translates to “Eighty-Eight Flowers,” is the standard pattern for today's hanafuda. These decks feature Ono No Michikaze with an open umbrella and a frog on the Willow Bright card, and a red and grey, more abstract design on the Willow Chaff. This standard design has few visual frills and are usually devoid of any metallic overprinting.</p>
