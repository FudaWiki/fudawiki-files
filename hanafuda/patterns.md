The following is a list of known hanafuda patterns, organized alphabetically, with links to individual pages on those for which we have gathered sufficient information.

For patterns featuring a particular cultural theme or intellectual property, see [Character Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda/character). For the Korean version of hanafuda, see [Hwatu](/en/hanafuda/hwatu).
- **Awa-Bana** - Also known as Kintoki-Bana. Most Chaff, Ribbons, and some other cards explicitly mention the month number on the cards. The Chaff of Pine and Susuki Grass have a very abridged version of the Echigo-bana poems. Includes an Onifuda which depicts Kintaro.
- **Bizen-Bana** - Described as having the same design as Echigo-Bana, but without poems.
- **Dairen-Bana** - Same design as Hachi-hachi-Bana except the Ribbons have Japanesque patterns on the background. Sold in Dalian in the Kwantung Leased Territory.
- **Echigo-Bana** - Copies the design of old woodblock-printed hanafuda. Characterized by very crude-looking drawings, striped skies, poems on the Chaff, and a liberal use of silver and gold paint on all cards. Rainman is depicted as braving a storm inside a closed umbrella, while the Chaff of Willow does not depict a Thunderstorm. Includes a red Onifuda card.
- [**Hachi-Hachi-Bana**](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana) - The standard pattern of hanafuda. Named after the game [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) which was the most popular hanafuda game in Japan during the early 20th century.
- **Hanamaki-Bana** - Design is the same as Echigo-bana, but with slightly better looking but still crude woodblock design, and an even cruder coloring method which seems as if there was no attempt to align them with the drawings.
- **Hokkai-Bana** - Speculated to have the same or similar coloring pattern as Echigo-bana, but with a better designed woodblock pattern.
- [**Mushi-Bana**](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) - Same design as Hachi-hachi-Bana except all Peony and Bush Clover cards are removed. Designed specifically for playing the game of [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi). Usually the style of drawings on the cards are in the style of Hachi-hachi-bana made in Osaka, to acknowledge the origin of the game.
- **Yamagata-Bana** - Design exactly the same as Hanamaki-Bana, except the yellow Paulownia junk has a small Ribbon on it, and in each month, there is one Chaff that is marked with a black dot, to differentiate it from the other chaff. Most likely used as a way to play mekuri-type or yomi-type games that required four distinct suits.
- **Yokohama-Bana** - Not much is known about this deck, except that it did not have any poems on them.
