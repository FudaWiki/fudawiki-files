UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Although by the 20th century, Hanafuda deck structure and design has established a standard, there have already existed a lot of variations in patterns and formats. These variations come from differences in development of Hanafuda in different regions in and even outside Japan.

The following is a list of known hanafuda variations, organized by type and alphabetically, with links to individual pages on those for which we have gathered sufficient information.

For patterns featuring a particular cultural theme or intellectual property, see [Character Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda/character). For the Korean version of hanafuda, see [Hwatu](/en/hanafuda/hwatu).

# Pattern Variations
## Regional Variants
|Name|Played In|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Awa-Bana** or **Kintoki-Bana**|-| Also known as Kintoki-Bana. Most Chaff, Ribbons, and some other cards explicitly mention the month number on the cards. The Chaff of Pine and Susuki Grass have a very abridged version of the Echigo-bana poems. Includes an Onifuda which depicts Kintaro.|
|**Bizen-Bana** |-| Described as an Echigo-bana variant without poems. Not much else is known about this deck.|
|**Echigo-Bana** |-| Copies the design of old woodblock-printed hanafuda. Characterized by very crude-looking drawings, striped skies, poems on the Chaff, and a liberal use of silver and gold paint on all cards. Rainman is depicted as braving a storm inside a closed umbrella, while the Chaff of Willow does not depict a Thunderstorm. Includes a red Onifuda card.|
|**Echigo-Ko-Bana** |-| An Echigo-bana variant but usually with no Waka poems. The Rainman has a raccoon tail, the yellow paulownia chaff has a small ribbon on it, and it sometimes comes with multiple Onifuda cards. The cards are smaller than Echigo-bana.|
|[**Hachi-Hachi-Bana**](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana) |Japan, Taiwan and some places in China, Karafuto (now South Sakhalin, Russia), Korea, Hawaii (USA), Palau| The standard pattern of hanafuda. Named after the game [Hachi-hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) which was the most popular hanafuda game in Japan during the early 20th century.|
|**Hanamaki-Bana** |-| The design resembles Echigo-bana, but with slightly better looking but still crude woodblock design, and an even cruder coloring method which seems as if there was no attempt to align them with the drawings.|
|**Hokkai-Bana** |-| Speculated to have the same or similar coloring pattern as Echigo-bana, but with a better designed woodblock pattern.|
|[**Mushi-Bana**](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) |-| Same design as Hachi-hachi-Bana except all Peony and Bush Clover cards are removed, making it technically a format variant. Designed specifically for playing the game of [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi). Usually the style of drawings on the cards are in the style of Hachi-hachi-bana made in Osaka, to acknowledge the origin of the game.|
|**Yamagata-Bana** or **Oshu-Bana**|-| A variant of Hanamaki-Bana, where the yellow Paulownia junk has a small Ribbon on it, and in each month, there is one Chaff that is marked with a black dot, to differentiate it from the other chaff. Most likely used as a way to play mekuri-type or yomi-type games that required four distinct suits.|
|**Yokohama-Bana** |-| Not much is known about this deck, except that it did not have any poems on them.

## International Variants
|Name|Played In|Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Dairen-Bana** |Dalian, Kwantung Leased Territory in China| Same design as Hachi-hachi-Bana except the Ribbons have Japanesque patterns on the background. Sold in Dalian in the Kwantung Leased Territory.|
|**Hwatu** |South Korea|This pattern evolved from the low-cost Hachi-hachi-bana pattern made by Nihon Karuta, where a lot of design elements were borrowed, such as the Geese colorization and the idea of putting a symbol on the Full Moon card. The origin of the circled 'å…‰' symbol is disputed, with both Oishi Tengudo and Nihon Karuta claiming to be the originator. Nowadays, Hwatu is mainly manufactured using plastic rather than paper.|

# Format Variations
## By Size

|**Juushigatsu-Bana**|14|Hachi-hachi-bana but with two extra months added: Bamboo and Lotus. However, the design of the cards of the Bamboo suit is different from Juusangatsu-Bana. Also Introduced by Matsui Tengudo.|

## Using Western-style Cardstock
|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|
|**Yasen Hanafuda**|Hachi-hachi-bana pattern printed on western-style playing card material. The deck is as thick as a typical western playing card deck, but the length and width of the cards are close to those of traditional hanafuda. Manufactured by Universal Playing Card Co.|
|**Bridge-Size**|Hachi-hachi-bana pattern printed on bridge-size western-style playing card material. The front of each card shows not only the hanafuda design, but also the points of the card as indices, and the name of the suit on the top, and the name of the month on the bottom. The card points may either be standard, or those used in Sakura, depending on the deck. Manufactured for export to Hawaii, USA, by different playing card companies including Nintendo.|
|**Hana-Trump**|Hachi-hachi-bana pattern printed on western-style playing card material. On the front of each card, the hanafuda design is printed in the middle, while the indices indicate its western playing card value. This makes it possible to be used for both Hanafuda games and Western playing card games. Available in different card dimensions, although typically it is slightly smaller than bridge size playing cards.|
