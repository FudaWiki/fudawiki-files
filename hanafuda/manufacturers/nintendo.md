Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a company most-known today as a video game manufacturer, but started out as a manufacturer of [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) and other [Karuta](/en/karuta). It was founded in September 1889 by Yamauchi Fusajirō (山内房治郎), who named the company Yamauchi Nintendo (山内任天堂).

In 1902, they started selling the first locally-produced [western playing cards](/en/trump) in Japan.

Nintendo’s manufacturer's mark is a circled 福 (*fuku*, ‘fortune’), called Marufuku (丸福).

The meaning of the name ‘Nintendo’ is not exactly known, but a U.S. Patent Office trademark describes it as “a corporation whose fortune or prosperity should be left to the mercy of heaven”. This could possibly be the origin of the phrase “leave luck to heaven”.

Despite being a full-fledged video game manufacturer, Nintendo still continues to manufacture Hanafuda today.

# Brands
Currently, Nintendo produces the standard Hanafuda pattern in 3 main brands, which differ only in the texture of the cards, and the packaging design.

| Brand | Packaging | Card texture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daitoryo**  <br>(大統領, president) | Beige-colored plastic box with a black/red flap that closes on both ends of the box. | Heavy clear-coat on the front; Glossy on the back |
| **Tengu**  <br>(天狗) | Beige-colored plastic box with a black/red flap that closes on both ends of the box. | Faint clear-coat on the front; Glossy on the back |
| **Miyako no Hana**  <br>(都の花, flowers of the capital) | Two-piece clear plastic box. | Uncoated front; Slightly matte back |

Nintendo also uses a different brand called “Chiyozakura”, which was first released sometime in the 1990's (possibly 1994) for sale in convenience stores. It has the same price as a Miyako no Hana deck, and the quality is the same.

| Brand | Packaging | Card texture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chiyozakura**  <br>(千代桜, Thousand-year Sakura) | Two-piece clear plastic box. | Uncoated front; Slightly matte back  <br>(Same as Miyako no Hana) |

In addition to the standard hanafuda decks, Nintendo currently produces Mario Hanafuda, which was first released in Japan on November 2015, and features characters from the Super Mario and Donkey Kong series on all of the cards. (Nintendo manufactured other character Hanafuda as well, such as Pokemon Hanafuda; since they did not publish those cards, they will not be listed here.)
