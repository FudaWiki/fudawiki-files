Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a company most-known today as a video game manufacturer, but started out as a manufacturer of [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) and other [Karuta](/en/karuta). It was founded in September 1889 by Yamauchi Fusajirō (山内房治郎), who named the company Yamauchi Nintendo (山内任天堂).

In 1902, they started selling the first locally-produced [western playing cards](/en/trump) in Japan.

Nintendo’s manufacturer's mark is a circled 福 (*fuku*, ‘fortune’), called Marufuku (丸福).

The meaning of the name ‘Nintendo’ is not exactly known, but a U.S. Patent Office trademark describes it as “a corporation whose fortune or prosperity should be left to the mercy of heaven”. This could possibly be the origin of the phrase “leave luck to heaven”, which is widely regarded to be the meaning of the name.

Despite being a full-fledged video game manufacturer, Nintendo still continues to manufacture Hanafuda today.

# Brands
Currently, Nintendo produces the standard Hanafuda pattern in 3 main brands, which differ only in the texture of the cards, and the packaging design.

| Brand | Label | Packaging | Card texture |
