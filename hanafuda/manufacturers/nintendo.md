Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a company most-known today as a video game manufacturer, but started out as a Hanafuda manufacturer. It was founded in September 1889 by Yamauchi Fusajirō (山内房治郎), who named the company Yamauchi Nintendo (山内任天堂).

Nintendo’s manufacturers mark is a circled 福 (*fuku*, ‘fortune’), called Marufuku (丸福).

The meaning of the name ‘Nintendo’ is not exactly known, but a U.S. Patent Office trademark describes it as “a corporation whose fortune or prosperity should be left to the mercy of heaven”. This could possibly be the origin of the phrase “leave luck to heaven”.

Despite being a full-fledged video game manufacturer, Nintendo still continues to manufacture Hanafuda today.

# Brands

Currently, Nintendo produces the standard Hanafuda pattern in 3 brands, which differ only in the texture of the cards, and the packaging design.

| Brand | Packaging | Card texture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daitoryo**<br><br>(大統領, president) | Beige-colored plastic box with a black/red flap that closes on both ends of the box. | Heavy clear-coat on the front; Glossy on the back |
| **Tengu**<br><br>(天狗) | Beige-colored plastic box with a black/red flap that closes on both ends of the box. | Faint clear-coat on the front; Glossy on the back |
| **Miyako no Hana**<br><br>(都の花, flowers of the capital) | Two-piece clear plastic box. | Uncoated front; Slightly matte back |

In addition, Nintendo currently produces Mario Hanafuda, which features characters from the Super Mario and Donkey Kong series on all of the cards. (Nintendo manufactured other character Hanafuda as well, such as Pokemon Hanafuda; since they did not publish those cards, they will not be listed here.)

| Brand | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Asahi Sakura**<br><br>(朝日桜, morning sun Sakura) | Came in two label designs. The old design was a diamond shape inside an oval, and shared the same label design with Goshozakura, Kumoizakura, and Yaezakura. The newer design looked similar to the label designs of Marufuku Sakura and Heian. |
| **Azuma Tengu**<br><br>(東天狗, Eastern Tengu) | Same label design as Tengu, but with silver background instead of gold. Could be the replacement for the brand Gintengu. Briefly succeeded by Daitengu in 1977. An example with a newer label design (probably from 1994 or later) had a gold background instead of silver, but the clothing of the Tengu was purple instead of green. |
| **Chiyozakura**<br><br>(千代桜, thousand-year Sakura) | Introduced in the 1990's (probably from 1994 or later). Same quality and price as Miyako no Hana, but with different packaging, and intended for sale in convenience stores. |
