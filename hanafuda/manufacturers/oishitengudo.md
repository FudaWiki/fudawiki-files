Ōishi Tengudō (大石天狗堂, also romanized variously as Oishi Tengudo, Ooishi Tengudo or Ohishi Tengudo) is a major Kyōto-based producer of traditional Japanese playing cards.

Ōishi Tengudō has several manufacturer marks. Usually it uses a Red beardless Tengu mask and a み with a ^ on top, but in the past, they also used a 大 in a square, and a 高 in a circle.

The meaning of the company name comes from the family name of the founder Kuranosuke Ōishi (大石蔵之介), and the Tengu, which is the secret term for hanafuda, in reference to rubbing one's nose to signal the seller that the person wants to buy hanafuda illegally.

Although their main product is [Ogura Hyakunin Isshu](https://fudawiki.org/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) Karuta, Ōishi Tengudō still continues to manufacture Hanafuda today.
