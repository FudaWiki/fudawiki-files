**Ōishi Tengudō** (大石天狗堂, also romanized variously as Oishi Tengudo, Ooishi Tengudo or Ohishi Tengudo) is a major Kyōto-based producer of traditional Japanese [Karuta](/en/karuta). They were founded in 1800 as *Minatoya*, during the time when selling karuta was illegal. To get around this, their cover business was a rice merchant

Ōishi Tengudō has several manufacturer marks. Usually it uses a Red beardless Tengu mask and a み with a ^ on top, but in the past, they also used a 大 in a square, and a 高 in a circle.

The meaning of the company name comes from the family name of the founder Kuranosuke Ōishi (大石蔵之介), and the Tengu, which is the secret term for hanafuda, in reference to rubbing one's nose to signal the seller that the person wants to buy hanafuda illegally.

Although their main product is [Ogura Hyakunin Isshu](https://fudawiki.org/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) Karuta, Ōishi Tengudō still continues to manufacture [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda), [Kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), and other types of Karuta, today.

# Current Brands of Hanafuda
- **Kintengu** (Golden Tengu) - Their high-end brand of Hanafuda decks. Has a papery finish on both front and back when compared to products made by other current Hanafuda manufacturers. The cards are intentionally curved as a result of employing manual processes in manufacturing.
- **Gintengu** (Silver Tengu) - Same quality as Kintengu but the centering of the backpaper is less accurate than Kintengu.
- **Lincoln** - Same quality as Kintengu but the centering of the backpaper is less accurate than Gintengu.
- **Shiki** (Four Seasons) - Has a completely different quality to the other three brands. The front and back are printed glossy paper, and no backpaper is applied, so the edges of the card are exposed.

# Currently Sold Special Hanafuda
- **Prime Minister's Hanakaruta** - this is a replica of a hanafuda deck that was commissioned by former Japanese Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi. The cards are larger and thicker than regular hanafuda cards, and have detailed woodblock patterns seemingly inspired by Echigo-bana. Waka poems are also included.
- **Echigobana** - a regional Hanafuda deck from Niigata prefecture. Copies the design of old woodblock-printed hanafuda from the Edo period. Characterized by very crude-looking drawings, striped skies, poems on the Chaff, and a liberal use of silver and gold paint on all cards. Rainman is depicted as braving a storm inside a closed umbrella, while the Chaff of Willow does not depict a Thunderstorm.
- **Echigokobana** - an Echigo-bana variant but smaller in dimensions and has no Waka poems. The Rainman has a raccoon tail, the yellow paulownia chaff has a small ribbon on it. Comes with 3 Onifuda cards.
- **Kintokibana** - a unique pattern from Shikoku island, with some silver overprints. Most Chaff, Ribbons, and some other cards explicitly mention the month number on the cards. The Chaff of Pine and Susuki Grass have a very abridged version of the Echigo-bana poems. Includes an Onifuda which depicts Kintaro.
