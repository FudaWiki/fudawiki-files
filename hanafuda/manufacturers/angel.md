In addition to the traditional designs, Angel also produces cardboard novelty character-themed hanafuda, such as those featuring Hello Kitty or Disney characters. # Bibliography Pollard, George. “Traditional Hanafuda Brands.” Ways To Play, games.porg.es/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/traditional-manufacturers/.

While is was stated that the company was established on November 28, 1956, trademark records show that they have registered the name "ANGEL エンゼル" as early as September 26, 1953, under the company name Angel Playing Card Kabushiki-Gaisha \[エンゼルプレイングカード株式会社\].
