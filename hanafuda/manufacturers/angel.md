Angel (エンゼル \*enzeru\*) is a Kyōto-based producer of western playing cards, hanafuda and other karuta. In addition to the traditional designs, Angel also produces cardboard novelty character-themed hanafuda, such as those featuring Hello Kitty or Disney characters.

While is was stated that the company was established on November 28, 1956, trademark records show that they have registered the name "ANGEL エンゼル" as early as September 26, 1953, under the company name Angel Playing Card Kabushiki-Gaisha \[エンゼルプレイングカード株式会社\].

Angel (as  Angel Shoji Kabushiki-Gaisha \[エンゼル商事株式会社\]) registered the "Okina" 翁 trademark on November 22, 1962. They would use this trademark on their hanafuda and other karuta products.

Despite being mainly focused as a playing card manufacturer and supplier of equipment for casinos, they still manufacture hanafuda and kabufuda to this day.
