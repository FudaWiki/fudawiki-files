<p>Angel's first registration in that database though was the word "ANGEL エンゼル" (romaji above katakana) on 1953/09/26 under the company name エンゼルプレイングカード株式会社 Angel Playing Card KK. Both companies seem to still exist (and the last registration for Angel Shoji KK was in 2008). One is probably the subsidiary of the other. (edited)</p>
<p>Angel (as エンゼル商事株式会社 Angel Shoji KK) registered the "okina" 翁 trademark on 1962/11/22</p>
