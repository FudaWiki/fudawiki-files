<p>Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a company most-known today as a video game manufacturer, but started out as a Hanafuda manufacturer. It was founded in September 1889 by Yamauchi Fusajirō (山内房治郎), who named the company Yamauchi Nintendo (山内任天堂).</p>
<p>Nintendo’s manufacturers mark is a circled 福 (<i>fuku</i>, ‘fortune’), called Marufuku (丸福).</p>
<p>The meaning of the name ‘Nintendo’ is not exactly known, but a U.S. Patent Office trademark describes it as “a corporation whose fortune or prosperity should be left to the mercy of heaven”. This could possibly be the origin of the phrase “leave luck to heaven”.</p>
<p>Despite being a full-fledged video game manufacturer, Nintendo still continues to manufacture Hanafuda today.</p>
<h1>Brands</h1>
<p>Currently, Nintendo produces the standard Hanafuda pattern in 3 main brands, which differ only in the texture of the cards, and the packaging design.</p>

<p>Nintendo also uses a different brand called “Chiyozakura”, which was first released sometime in the 1990's (possibly 1994) for sale in convenience stores. It has the same price as a Miyako no Hana deck, and the quality is the same.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard hanafuda decks, Nintendo currently produces Mario Hanafuda, which was first released in Japan on November 2015, and features characters from the Super Mario and Donkey Kong series on all of the cards. (Nintendo manufactured other character Hanafuda as well, such as Pokemon Hanafuda; since they did not publish those cards, they will not be listed here.)</p>

Came as a set of Gold-back and Silver-back decks, in a very large paulownia box with Mario engraved on it along with other hanafuda motifs and the word はなふだ (hanafuda) and the Marufuku logo.

The decks were not wrapped; only encased in a two piece plastic box with a clear top and black bottom. The faces of the cards have gold outlines on the gold deck and silver outlines on the silver deck.</td>
