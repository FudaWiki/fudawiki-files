**Ginsekai** (銀世界, Silver World) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) high-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. 

The brand shares the exact same label design as [Kaoh jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kaoh). However, the latter brand was not mentioned in pre-war Nintendo card catalogues.

It was the 6th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo's hanafuda lineup, behind [Shiko jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/shiko).

The brand was known to be used around the 1920's and 1930's before it was discontinued. However, the brand has been listed on the end of the wrapper of most Nintendo decks (until 1963). The brand has become extremely rare. To this day, there is only one known existing deck that appeared on the internet.
