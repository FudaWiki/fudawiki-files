**Yaezakura** (八重桜, Double-layered Sakura) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks.
 
The label has a diamond in oval pattern. This label design is shared with other brands such as [Goshozakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/goshozakura), [Hyakuman-en](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hyakuman-en), [Kumoizakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kumoizakura), and [Asahi Sakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/asahi_sakura).

It was the 10th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, alongside [Gintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/gintengu) and [Kikusui](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kikusui), behind [Marufuku jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/marufuku_jirushi) and followed by [Konishiki jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/konishiki).

It is known to have existed in the 1920's and 1930's. Decks have become quite rare, and only a few have been shown to exist on the internet.
