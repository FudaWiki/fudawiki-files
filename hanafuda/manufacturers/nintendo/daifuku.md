**Daifuku** (大福, Great Fortune) was [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brand of [mushibana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) decks. It ranks below [Daikoku](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/daikoku).

It was known to be used during the 1930's, and was discontinued early. Existing decks are extremely rare; There was a pair of red and black Nintendo hanafuda decks contained in a wooden box with a label of this brand, though it's unknown if the decks actually belong to the box.
