**Konishiki jirushi** (小錦印, Small Brocade Mark) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks.

It features what could possibly be a loincloth of a sumo wrestler, hence the brand name.

It was the 11th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, behind [Gintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/gintengu), [Kikusui](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kikusui) and [Yaezakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/yaezakura) and followed by [Kikumaku](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kikumaku).

It was known to be used in the 1920's and 1930's. The brand has become so rare that no existing deck has ever appeared on the internet.
