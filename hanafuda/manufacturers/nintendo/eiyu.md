**Eiyu** (英雄, Hero) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mushibana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana), and other regional karuta decks.
  
It features a portrait of Saigo Takamori (西郷隆盛, January 23, 1828 – September 24, 1877), famously considered as "the last Samurai" and one of The Three Nobles who led the Meiji Restoration.
 
As a kabufuda brand, it was of the same rank as [Kintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kintengu), ranks below [Chujo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/chujo), and ranks above [Marufuku jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/marufuku_jirushi).

As a mushibana brand, it ranks below Chujo and ranks above [Kikumaku](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kikumaku).

As a regional karuta brand, it ranks below Chujo and [Kinryu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kinryu), and ranks above Marufuku jirushi.

It was known to be used until as late as 1944-1946 before it was discontinued. However, the brand has been listed on the end of the wrapper of most Nintendo decks (until 1963).  The brand was quite rare, and only a few existing kabufuda decks appeared on the internet.
