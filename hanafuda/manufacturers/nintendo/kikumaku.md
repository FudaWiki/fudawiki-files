**Kikumaku** (菊幕, Chrysanthemum Curtain) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) and [mushibana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) decks.

It was the 12th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, behind [Konishiki jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/konishiki) and followed by [Tokiwa](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/tokiwa).

It was known to be used in the 1920's and 1930's. The brand has become so rare that no existing deck has ever appeared on the internet.
