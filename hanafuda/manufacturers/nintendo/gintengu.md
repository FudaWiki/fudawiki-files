**Gintengu** (金天狗, Silver Tengu) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. As the name suggests, it ranks lower than [Kintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kintengu) (金天狗, Golden Tengu).

It usually features a silver background, and a portrait of a red-skinned Tengu with a large, pointed nose and a long, white beard. It is depicted holding a magical feather fan called *hauchiwa* (羽団扇).

It was the 10th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, alongside [Yaezakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/yaezakura) and [Kikusui](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kikusui), behind [Marufuku jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/marufuku_jirushi) and followed by [Konishiki jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/konishiki).

It is one of 6 Nintendo brands to feature a Tengu in the label, the others being [Tengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/tengu), [Kintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kintengu), [Ohtengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/ohtengu), [Azuma Tengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/azuma_tengu), and [Daitengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/daitengu).

Brand names aside, this brand shares similar traits with Azuma Tengu and Daitengu, as all 3 brands feature a silver background and feature similar Tengu illustrations.

The brand was known to exist during the 1920's and 1930's, but was discontinued very early, possibly due to trademark conflicts with [Oishi Tengudo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/oishitengudo). This made the brand extremely rare. Only one deck in a wooden box has appeared on the internet, and a photo of an unused box label also appeared, which is what is shown in this page.
