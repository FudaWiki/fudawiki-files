**Hana no Yama**  (花の山 or 花乃山, Mountain of Flowers) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks.

It features, on a silver background, a bunch of mountains with some [cherry blossoms](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom) visible near the base of the mountains. It shares the same label design with [Tsukimi Yama](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/tsukimi_yama). Another brand called [Sakura no Yama](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/sakura_no_yama) has a label design based on this one.

It was the 17th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, behind [Hi no De](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hi_no_de) and followed by [Miyako no Hana](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/miyako_no_hana).

It was known to be used during late 1920's to the early 1960's before being discontinued.
