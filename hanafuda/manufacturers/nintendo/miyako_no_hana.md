**Miyako No Hana** (都の花, flowers of the capital), is [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brand of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks, and is still in use today. It can be seen in various Nintendo card catalogues as the lowest priced hanafuda brand in their line-up.

The label features pink [cherry blossoms](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom) and [willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) branches, a flowing river, and a basket lattice pattern, on a background of a red sky with orange clouds.
