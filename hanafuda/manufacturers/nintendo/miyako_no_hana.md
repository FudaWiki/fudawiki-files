**Miyako No Hana** (都の花, flowers of the capital), was [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brand of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks from the very early Showa era, and is still in use today. 

The label features pink [cherry blossoms](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom) and [willow](/en/hanafuda/suits/willow) branches, a flowing river, and a basket lattice pattern, on a background of a red sky with orange clouds.

The brand became a registered trademark in the Japan Patent Office in the year 1930. Since then, it can be seen in various Nintendo card catalogues as the lowest priced hanafuda brand in their line-up.

During the 1930's, it was the 18th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, behind [Hana no Yama](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hana_no_yama). It also shared the same price range as [Fuji](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/fuji), which was Nintendo's budget [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda) brand.
