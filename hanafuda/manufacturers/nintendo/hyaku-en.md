**Hyaku-en** (百圓, 100 yen) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks.

It depicts a late-Meiji-to-early-Showa-era coin with a value of 100 yen, which is a fantasy (the highest denomination bearing this coin design was 20 yen). The chrysanthemum crest was also replaced with what could possibly be a [paulownia](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia) flower.

It was the 15th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, behind [Hatsuzakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hatsuzakura) and followed by [Hi no De](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hi_no_de).

It is known to be used during the 1920’s and 1930’s, and was discontinued very early. Existing decks have become quite rare.
