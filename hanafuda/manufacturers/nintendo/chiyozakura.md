**Chiyozakura** (千代桜, Thousand-year Sakura) is [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brand of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks intended to be sold in convenience stores in Japan. 

Quality and price-wise, it is exactly the same as [Miyako No Hana](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/miyako_no_hana), just with a different label and packaging.

The brand was introduced around 1994, the year when Nintendo made some efforts to promote hanafuda to new generation of players by introducing a self-contained instruction leaflet for beginners called "Modern [Koi-koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi)", and radically changing the design of their plastic boxes from a cover-type to a snap-type.

It seems to be still sold today, though recently it is increasingly difficult to find in convenience stores in Japan.
