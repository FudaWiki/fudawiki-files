**Sanbazuru** (三羽鶴, Three cranes) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) premier brand of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. 

The earliest known mention of this brand is from an ad from 1929 about various Nintendo brands of playing cards. Despite this, the brand is surprisingly absent in pre-war Nintendo card catalogues. 

The brand continued to be used until the 1980's. It was mentioned in an IPCS Journal from 1981 that the brand was discontinued; However, a Nintendo card catalogue from 1983 contains the brand. 

In both the 1971 Nintendo price list and 1983 Nintendo card catalogue, the brand was put at the same price point as [Otafuku](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/otafuku), making it the second-highest ranking brand alongside Otafuku.
