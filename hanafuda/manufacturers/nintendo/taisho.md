**Taisho** (大将, General) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) premier brand of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda), [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), and other karuta decks. 

It was the 2nd highest-ranking brand in Nintendo's hanafuda lineup, only behind [Daitoryo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/daitoryo). 

It was also one of Nintendo's oldest registered trademarks for hanafuda decks. The oldest surviving reference to the brand was in the Japan Patent Office Records, where the trademark was registered in 1900, a year before even Daitoryo was registered.

Despite being the 2nd highest-ranking brand and despite being featured on the side of the wrapper of most Nintendo decks (until 1967), Taisho decks are extremely rare. To this day, there is only one known existing deck that appeared on the internet.
