**Fuji** (不二, Peerless) was [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brand of [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), and other karuta decks. *(It was not used for [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks.)*

As a budget brand, it shared the same price range as [Miyako no Hana](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/miyako_no_hana), which was Nintendo's budget brand of hanafuda decks. It ranks below [Hi no De](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hi_no_de).

It was known to be used around the 1930's, and was discontinued quite early.
