**Marufuku jirushi** (丸福印, Marufuku mark) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda), [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), and other karuta decks.
 
It was the 9th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo's hanafuda lineup, behind both [Asahi Sakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/asahi_sakura) and [Kintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kintengu), and followed by [Yaezakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/yaezakura), [Kikusui](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kikusui), and [Gintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/gintengu).

The brand is extremely rare, and no existing deck has showed up on the internet, though a box of one existed (but it contained a deck of a different manufacturer).
