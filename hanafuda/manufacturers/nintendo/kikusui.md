**Kikusui** (菊水, Chrysanthemum Water) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks.

It features a bunch of colorful [chrysanthemum](/en/hanafuda/suits/chrysanthemum) flowers floating in the silver sky with the clouds. It shares the same label design with [Hagoromo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hagoromo).

It was the 10th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, alongside [Gintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/gintengu) and [Yaezakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/yaezakura), behind [Marufuku jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/marufuku_jirushi) and followed by [Konishiki jirushi](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/konishiki).

It was known to be used in the 1920's and 1930's. The brand has become extremely rare, and only one existing deck has appeared on the internet.
