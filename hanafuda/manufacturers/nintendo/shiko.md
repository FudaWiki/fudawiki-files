**Shiko Jirushi** (四光印, Four Lights mark) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) high-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. 

The brand is named after the [yaku](/en/hanafuda/yaku) of the same name. As such, it is not surprising that the brand was not used for [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), and other karuta decks. 

It was the 5th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo's hanafuda lineup, behind [Masamune](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/masamune).

The brand was known to be used as late as the 1930's before it was discontinued. The brand has become extremely rare. To this day, there is only one known existing deck that appeared on the internet.
