**Chujo** (中将, Lieutenant General) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) high-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda), [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), and other karuta decks. 

It depicts a portrait of a Japanese Lieutenant General, though his identity is unknown.

It was the 7th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo's hanafuda lineup, behind [Ginsekai](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/ginsekai).

The brand was possibly used until the early 1940's before it was discontinued. The brand has become quite rare, but not as rare as the thematically-related brand, [Taisho](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/taisho).
