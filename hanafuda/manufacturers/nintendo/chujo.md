**Chujo** (中将, Lieutenant General) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) middle-class brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda), [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), and other karuta decks. 

It depicts a portrait of a Japanese Lieutenant General, though his identity is unknown.

It was the 7th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo's hanafuda lineup, behind [Ginsekai](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/ginsekai) and followed by both [Asahi Sakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/asahi_sakura) and [Kintengu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kintengu).

As a regional karuta brand, it shared the same price point with [Kinryu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kinryu), and ranks above [Eiyu](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/eiyu).

The brand was possibly used until the early 1940's before it was discontinued. The brand has become quite rare, but not as rare as the thematically-related brand, [Taisho](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/taisho).
