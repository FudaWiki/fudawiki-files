**Masamune** (正宗) was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) premier brand of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda), [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), [mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), and other karuta decks. 

It was the 4th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo's hanafuda lineup, behind [Otafuku](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/otafuku).

It was also one of Nintendo's oldest registered trademarks for hanafuda decks. The oldest surviving reference to the brand was in the Japan Patent Office Records, where the trademark was registered in 1900, a year before even [Daitoryo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/daitoryo) was registered.

The brand was known to be used as late as the 1930's before it was discontinued. Existing decks have become extremely rare.
