**Tokiwa** (常磐, Eternal), also known as **Marufuku Tokiwa** (丸福常磐), was one of [Nintendo's](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo) budget brands of [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks.

It mimics the label design of a Murai Bros. cigarette brand of the same name. The sky and trees have become less detailed, and the word 'Tokiwa' written in roman letters has been replaced with the word 'MARUFUKU' also written in roman letters.

The wrapper label is also unique in that the label illustration wraps both sides of the wrapper.

It was the 13th highest-ranking brand in Nintendo’s hanafuda lineup, behind [Kikumaku](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/kikumaku) and followed by [Hatsuzakura](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo/hatsuzakura).

It is known to be used during the 1920's and 1930's, and was discontinued very early. Existing decks have become quite rare.
