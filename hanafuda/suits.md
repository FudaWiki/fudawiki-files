There are 12 suits of 4 cards each in the standard [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) deck. These are presented below in various orders, each of which may be utilized depending on the game played or the region of origin. Some specialty decks also contain a 13th or both 13th and 14th suit, which are added to the deck to enable altered gameplay or a greater number of participants.
# Arrangement of Suits
The following chart shows the ordering of the suits according to different schemes. The column labeled "Standard" is the most common ordering used for Japanese hanafuda games, and should be used unless otherwise specified. The Korean order is assumed for games originally played with [hwatu](/en/hanafuda/hwatu), and is identical to the standard Japanese suit order, but with Paulownia and Willow swapped.

The "Kabu" column reflects a hanafuda deck with the last two suits stripped out, making it suitable for games originally played with the 40-card [kabufuda](/en/kabufuda) deck. The "Mushi" column is similar, but reflects instead the [mushibana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/mushibana) deck which lacks the Peony and Bush Clover cards, and is used to play [Osaka Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi).

The order reflected in the final column is used in certain Japanese games, including Tensho, Hiyoko, and Isuri. It is mostly similar to the standard order, but with Plum Blossom, Peony, Willow, and Paulownia shuffled about.
