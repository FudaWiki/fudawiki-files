**Hanafuda Divination** is a form of cartomancy where a [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) deck is used to read a person's fortune.

There are endless variations in performing hanafuda divination, depending on the region, the method used, the guide in reading the hanafuda designs, and the intuition of the cartomancer themself. Sometimes, hanafuda divination is used in conjunction with divination using other types of cards, or even divination with crystals.

Typically, each method has a table of their own interpretation of the meanings of the hanafuda designs, which usually considers the suits of the cards, but sometimes, the types of cards are also considered.

>When performing cartomancy to read another person's fortune, you must take in consideration their feelings and explain the cards to them in a gentle manner, especially if there are many bad cards that appeared.

## From James Yong Kerby
All 48 cards of the deck are used.

### Setup and Instructions

**Shuffle** the deck well, and place 4 face-down cards in a row on the table. Next, place 4 more face-down cards in a row, each partially covering the bottom part of the 1st row (similar to setting up the cards in Klondike, except each stack has an equal number of cards). Keep doing this until there are **4 fanned stacks of face-down cards on the table, with each stack having 4 cards**.

Finally, place **4 face-up cards partially covering the 4th row**, and the "Solitaire game" begins.

- If there are any **two** face-up cards on the bottom of each stack with **matching suits**, remove them from the stacks and **set them aside in a specific manner (described below)**.

>**Each matching pair is set aside in one of four face-up piles** in a specific manner: The first pair goes into the first pile, the second pair goes into the second pile, the third pair goes into the third pile, and the fourth pair goes into the fourth pile. The fifth pair goes on top of the first pile, 6th pair on top of 2nd pile, 7th pair on top of 3rd pile, 8th pair on top of 4th pile, 9th pair on top of 1st pile, 10th pair on top of 2nd pile, and so on. At the end of the "solitaire game", all the cards will have been placed into one of these piles.
{.is-info}

>You cannot match three matching cards at once.
{.is-warning}

- If the **bottom card of a stack is a face-down card** after you have removed any matching cards, **flip** that face-down card face-up.



If there are no more matching cards, **place a card in a separate row below the stacks**.

- If it matches suit with any of the **face-up cards on the bottom of each stack**, take the pair of matching cards and **set them aside in the manner already described above**.

**Continue the above process until there are no more cards left in the draw pile**.

Finally, check the four piles of cards that were set aside, **look for any sets of four cards of the same suit within each pile, and write down their meanings** in order to read your fortune.

## From Lucky Lynx
All 48 cards of the deck are used.

This method is intended only for reading your own fortune, but Lucky Lynx believes that it can also be used for reading the fortunes of other people.

Lucky Lynx describes the method as "playing Solitaire" with the cards, after which you must look for any sets of four cards of the same suit among the cards you've matched, and read their meanings. However, Lucky Lynx also mentions that sometimes the "Solitaire" method isn't necessary for the cards to reveal your fortune.

### Setup and Instructions

**Shuffle** the deck well, and place 4 face-down cards in a row on the table, and 4 face-up cards in a row above the face-down row. Next, place 4 more face-down cards in a row, each partially covering the bottom part of the 1st face-down row (similar to setting up the cards in Klondike, except each stack has an equal number of cards). Keep doing this until there are **4 fanned stacks of face-down cards on the table, each stack having 4 cards, and 4 face-up cards above the 4 face-down stacks**.

Next, place **4 face-up cards partially covering the 4th face-down row**.

>If there are cards with matching suits on the above row, then stack them together.
{.is-info}

#### Playing Process
If there are any face-up cards at the bottom of any of the stacks that **match suit with any of the cards on the above face-up row**, remove them from the stack(s) and **place them on top of the matching card on the above face-up row**. Otherwise, **place 1 face-up card at the bottom of each stack (forming another row of 4 face-up cards below)**, and look for any matching cards again.

**Continue the above process until there are no more cards left in the draw pile**.

Finally, check the cards on the above face-up row, **look for any sets of four cards of the same suit, and write down their meanings** in order to read your fortune.

>During the process, there are only a maximum of 4 suits that can be used in revealing the fortune, since the matching cards need to include any of the four face-up cards in the row above the stacks. So right away during the setup, you can already imagine what fortune you will get, but you need to "play Solitaire" to confirm those fortunes.

## From Nintendo Hana Cards Booklet (1950's)
40 cards of the deck are used, excluding the joker and the peony ![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x) and bush clover ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x) suits.

This method is used to read a person's fortune in the near future. You can either read your own fortune or somebody else's. 

### Setup and Instructions
**Shuffle** the deck and divide it roughly into **3 equal face-down piles**.

The person whose fortune will be read must **choose one** of the 3 piles. 

Once a pile has been chosen, place the cards from the chosen pile on the table **face-up, one-by-one, in a row from left to right**.

Using the guide below, **write down the meaning** of each face-up card that appeared from left to right, and **piece the meanings together** in order to read the person's fortune.

*Whatever you do, you must calmly reflect and think about it. But, even though difficult obstacles are expected in the future, if you reflect on your actions and decide that you are doing the right thing, you can resolutely stick to your original intention and forge ahead with single-minded determination. However, if you are too confident and stubborn in sticking to your original intention, you may be tripped up by others, but if you exercise self-restraint, you will be able to seize the opportunity and achieve your goals. And if you maintain a humble attitude and follow your own path, you will be recognized and famous in society, and your later years will be very auspicious.*

## From ParaGlitter
All 48 cards of the deck are used.

This method can only be used to read your own fortune; If another person touches any of the cards during the divination process, the result is nullified. 

By default, this method reveals your fortune in the near future; However, it can also be used for answering specific questions, by **asking the question during shuffling**.

### Setup and Instructions
ParaGlitter had two videos about Hanafuda Divination, and she used a different setup in each video.

#### SETUP A
**Shuffle** the deck well, and place 4 face-down cards in a row on the table, and 4 face-up cards in a row above the face-down row. Next, place 4 more face-down cards in a row, each partially covering the bottom part of the 1st face-down row (similar to setting up the cards in Klondike, except each stack has an equal number of cards). Keep doing this until there are **4 fanned stacks of face-down cards on the table, each stack having 4 cards, and 4 face-up cards above the 4 face-down stacks**.

>If there are cards with matching suits on the above row, then stack them together.
{.is-info}

Finally, **flip all 4 cards in the bottom row face-up**, and the "Solitaire game" begins.

#### Playing Process for Setup A
- If there are any face-up cards on the bottom of each stack with **matching suits**, remove them from the stacks and **place them in the above row**.

- If the **bottom card of a stack is a face-down card** after you have removed any matching cards, **flip** that face-down card face-up.

- If a **face-up card on the bottom of a stack matches suit with the cards in the above row**, remove it from the stack and place it among the other cards that match suit with it.

>You cannot match a card on the bottom of a stack with a card in the middle of a stack.
{.is-warning}

If there are no more matching cards, **place 1 face-up card at the bottom of each stack (forming another row of 4 face-up cards below)**, and look for any matching cards again.

**Continue the above process until there are no more cards left in the draw pile**.

Finally, check all the matching cards that were set aside, **look for any sets of four cards of the same suit, and write down their meanings** in order to read your fortune.

#### SETUP B
**Shuffle** the deck well, and place 4 face-down cards in a row on the table. Next, place 4 more face-down cards in a row, each partially covering the bottom part of the 1st row (similar to setting up the cards in Klondike, except each stack has an equal number of cards). Keep doing this until there are **4 fanned stacks of face-down cards on the table, with each stack having 4 cards**.

Finally, place **4 face-up cards partially covering the 4th row**, and the "Solitaire game" begins.

#### Playing Process for Setup B
- If there are any face-up cards on the bottom of each stack with **matching suits**, remove them from the stacks and **set them aside**.

- If the **bottom card of a stack is a face-down card** after you have removed any matching cards, **flip** that face-down card face-up.

- If a **face-up card on the bottom of a stack matches suit with the cards that were set aside**, remove it from the stack and place it among the other cards that match suit with it.

>You cannot match a card on the bottom of a stack with a card in the middle of a stack.
{.is-warning}

If there are no more matching cards, **place 1 face-up card at the bottom of each stack (forming another row of 4 face-up cards below)**, and look for any matching cards again.

**Continue the above process until there are no more cards left in the draw pile**.

Finally, check all the matching cards that were set aside, **look for any sets of four cards of the same suit, and write down their meanings** in order to read your fortune.
