**Hanafuda Divination** is a form of cartomancy where a [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) deck is used to read a person's fortune.

There are endless variations in performing hanafuda divination, depending on the region, the method used, the guide in reading the hanafuda designs, and the intuition of the cartomancer themself.

Typically, each method has a table of their own interpretation of the meanings of the hanafuda designs, which usually considers the suits of the cards, but sometimes, the types of cards are also considered.

>When performing cartomancy to read another person's fortune, you must take in consideration their feelings and explain the cards to them in a gentle manner, especially if there are many bad cards that appeared.

# List of Known Methods and Card Meanings

## Nintendo Hana Cards Booklet
This method can be used to read your own fortune, or somebody else's. 40 cards of the deck are used, excluding the joker and the peony ![Icon for month 6](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x) and bush clover ![Icon for month 7](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x) suits.

The cartomancer thoroughly **shuffles** the deck and divides it roughly into **3 equal face-down piles**.

The person whose fortune will be read must **choose one** of the 3 piles. The cards in the pile are then placed by the cartomancer on the table **face-up, one-by-one, from left to right**.

The cartomancer then **writes down the meaning** of each face-up card from left to right, and **pieces the meanings together** in order to read the person's fortune.

*Whatever you do, you must calmly reflect and think about it. But, even though difficult obstacles are expected in the future, if you reflect on your actions and decide that you are doing the right thing, you can resolutely stick to your original intention and forge ahead with single-minded determination. However, if you are too confident and stubborn in sticking to your original intention, you may be tripped up by others, but if you exercise self-restraint, you will be able to seize the opportunity and achieve your goals. And if you maintain a humble attitude and follow your own path, you will be recognized and famous in society, and your later years will be very auspicious.*
