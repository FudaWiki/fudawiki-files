# Character Hanafuda by Publisher

## Angel
Angel's character hanafuda are numerous, but of generally lower quality - they are more for collecting than for playing. They are printed on cardboard, with exposed sides.
- Hello Kitty

## Bandai
- Mōretsu Atarō [もーれつア太郎, "Extraordinary Atarō"]

## Nintendo
Nintendo's character hanafuda tend to be of intermediate quality; they are properly backpapered like traditional karuta and come in reusable plastic cases, but the print quality may not be quite as good as their main lines of hanafuda.
- Club Nintendo
- Kirby
- Mario
- Mario Pikachu
- Pokemon

## Yanoman
These hanafuda are generally considered to be of higher quality than those made by Angel, but are still not backpapered. Their sides are black to match the borders and backs, rather than bare cardboard.

- Yokai Hana Asobi
