This page contains answers to some common questions related to [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) and [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi).
# Decks
## 1. What is this white card for?
The white card [白札 - しろふだ, *shirofuda*] included in many decks has a few uses:
1. For games such as [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) with more than 3 players that require some to drop out each round, the white card can be shuffled with the deck to allow 7 people to participate in the game. In this case, the player dealt the white card is automatically required to drop out, and the other 6 cards in their hand become the field for the match.
2. In the case that another card in the deck becomes lost, which would make the deck unsuitable to play most games, the white card can be used to replace the missing card. When this is the case, the necessary details of the missing card are often drawn on the blank card.
3.  In some decks, especially those by Nintendo, the white card is not completely blank, but has a number and/or some kanji printed on it. The number or kanji may sometimes be helpful in dating a deck; starting in the early 2000s, Nintendo began printing the date on these cards, in YYMMDD format. Older decks often have 5- or 6-digit numbers as well, but it is less clear whether or how these can be interpreted as dates.
## 2. Why does my deck have 5 [Cherry Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom) cards?
Many decks, though not all, include an extra card outside of the wrapper. This is called a "sample" [見本 - みほん, *mihon*] card, and its purpose is to display the quality of the deck within the wrapper. It is not traditionally intended for play, and may sometimes be marked with a cut corner to distinguish it as such.

This sample card may take the form of any card in the deck, but is very frequently a copy of the [Cherry Blossom Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon) with "見本" in place of the usual "みよしの" *miyoshino*.

In a pinch, a sample card in good condition may be used to fill the role of a joker or the white card for gameplay.
## 3. What's the difference between [Nintendo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo)'s hanafuda decks?
Nintendo currently has three major brands of standard hanafuda cards, though historically they have sold many many more. These brands all feature the same artwork, but may be considered to be of differing levels of "quality". The biggest difference seems to be in the weight of the cards and the protective coating that is applied to them. Starting with the "best," these are:
1. President [大統領 - だいとうりょう, *daitōryō*] which features a portrait of Napoleon on the box and wrapper.
2. Tengu [天狗 - てんぐ] which features a a red, long-nosed goblin, with a long white beard.
3. Flowers of the Capital [都の花, みやこのはな, *miyako no hana*] which has a brightly colored background with hanging willow, white cherry blossoms, and a stream. 

Nintendo also makes various [Character Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda/character) decks whose cards are decorated with characters from, for example, the Mario or Kirby franchise.
