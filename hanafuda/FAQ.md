This page contains answers to some common questions related to [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) and [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi). Please note that this page contains original research.
# Decks and Cards
## 1. What is this white card for?
The white card [白札 - しろふだ, *shirofuda*] included in many decks has a few uses:
1. For games such as [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) with more than 3 players that require some to drop out each round, the white card can be shuffled with the deck to allow 7 people to participate in the game. In this case, the player dealt the white card is automatically required to drop out, and the other 6 cards in their hand become the field for the match.
2. In the case that another card in the deck becomes lost, which would make the deck unsuitable to play most games, the white card can be used to replace the missing card. When this is the case, the necessary details of the missing card are often drawn onto the blank card.
3.  In some decks, especially those by Nintendo, the white card is not completely blank, but has a number and/or some kanji printed on it. The number or kanji may sometimes be helpful in dating a deck; starting in the early 2000s, Nintendo began printing the date on these cards, in YYMMDD format. Older decks often have 5- or 6-digit numbers as well, but it is less clear whether or how these can be interpreted as dates.
## 2. Why does my deck have 5 [Cherry Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom) cards?
Many decks, though not all, include an extra card outside of the wrapper. This is called a "sample" [見本 - みほん, *mihon*] card, and its purpose is to display the quality of the deck within the wrapper. It is not traditionally intended for play, and may sometimes be marked with a cut corner to distinguish it as such.

This sample card may take the form of any card in the deck, but is very frequently a copy of the [Cherry Blossom Ribbon](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon) with "見本" in place of the usual "みよしの" *miyoshino*.

In a pinch, a sample card in good condition may be used to fill the role of a joker or the white card for gameplay.
## 3. What do the Poetry Ribbons say?
For the standard [Hachihachibana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana) design, the [Pine](/en/hanafuda/suits/pine#poetry-ribbon) and [Plum Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#poetry-ribbon) cards read あかよろし *akayoroshi*, which is one of many names for the yaku consisting of the three Poetry Ribbons that appears in many games. The literal translation is akin to "Red is good."

The [Cherry Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon) card instead reads みよしの *miyoshino* in reference to Mt. Yoshino in the Nara Prefecture of Japan, which is renowned for its bountiful Cherry Blossom trees.

Those are the standard inscriptions, but note that some (especially older) decks use different text for the Ribbons, and may not limit the text to the three cards we now think of as Poetry Ribbons! For instance, decks made by [Tanaka Gyokusuido](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/tanaka-gyokusuido) feature an alternate name for the aforementioned yaku on each of the three relevant cards - うらす *urasu*, よろし *yoroshi*, and すがわら *sugawara* - and also have the name of another yaku, たてさん *tatesan* on the [Wisteria](/en/hanafuda/suits/wisteria), [Iris](/en/hanafuda/suits/iris), and [Bush Clover](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover) Ribbons. 
## 4. What are the differences between [Nintendo](/en/hanafuda/manufacturers/nintendo)'s different hanafuda decks?
Nintendo currently has three major brands of standard hanafuda cards, though historically they have sold many many more. These brands all feature the same [artwork](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana), but may be considered to be of differing levels of "quality". The biggest differences seem to be in the weight of the cards and the protective coating that is applied to them. From "best" to "worst", these are:
1. President [大統領 - だいとうりょう, *daitōryō*] which features a portrait of Napoleon on the box and wrapper.
2. Tengu [天狗 - てんぐ] which features a a red, long-nosed goblin, with a long white beard.
3. Flowers of the Capital [都の花, みやこのはな, *miyako no hana*] which has green hanging willow, white cherry blossoms, and a stream, over a bright red and yellow background. 

Nintendo also makes various [Character Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda/character) decks whose cards are decorated with characters from, for example, the Mario or Kirby franchise.
## 5. Where can I buy \_\_\_\_\_ deck?
Unfortunately there is no centralized location to find a given deck you might want; however, see [Places to Buy Hanafuda](/en/meta/external-sites#places-to-buy-hanafuda) for some starting points.
## 6. What's the difference between Hanafuda and [Kabufuda](/en/kabufuda)?
These are two different kinds of Japanese playing cards, similar in size and shape, but much different with regards to actual card design and deck configuration. Whereas hanafuda consist of 12 suits of 4 cards each, and are decorated with somewhat abstracted images of East Asian flowers, kabufuda consist of 4 copies each of values 1 to 10, mostly represented by black stripes (abstracted from the Western suit of clubs).

It is important to note that the two decks are not interchangeable in terms of what games they can be used to play; kabufuda games can be adapted to play using hanafuda by assigning each suit a numerical value (see [here](/en/hanafuda/suits#arrangement-of-suits)), but kabufuda cannot generally be used to play hanafuda games because of the differing deck structures.

Note as well that hanafuda and kabufuda come in very similar packaging, often with the exact same brands and images; for example, Nintendo sells *daitōryō* brands of both these decks, with identical packaging with the exception of the addition of the kanji "株札" [かぶふだ, *kabufuda*] or even just "株" [かぶ,*kabu*] on the bottom right of the kabufuda box.
## 7. What's the difference between hanafuda and hwatu? Which should I buy?
There are two ways to look at this. First, the word "hwatu" can be taken to mean "Korean hanafuda." From this point of view, any flower cards made in Korea, and intended for consumption in Korea, are hwatu, regardless of the art style or construction of the cards. 

On the other hand, one might consider the word to refer to a particular style and construction of flower card deck, which is the most common realization of the former definition of "hwatu." These cards are made of thick (usually, but not always red) plastic, with a checkered texture on the back and a smooth front. The artwork on the cards differs slightly in style from their Japanese counterparts. Notably, the five Bright cards each feature a circled 光 [ひかり, *hikari*, "light"] symbol, which may be useful to beginners for distinguishing betwen those and the Animal cards. Furthermore, these decks often include between one and six "joker" or extra cards, which differ in design among manufacturers.

The hwatu described in the previous paragraph may be considered a good choice for beginners because of the marked Brights, as well as their being less delicate than the paper-made hanafuda. The extra cards may also be useful for playing the popular Korean game [Go-Stop](/en/hanafuda/games/go-stop), which regularly makes use of them. Aside from these factors, the games playable with hwatu and hanafuda are the same, regardless of how you define "hwatu," so beginners need not fret over the choice of one over the other.
## 8. What do I need to look out for when buying a deck?
In no particular order, some considerations when buying a deck, and especially your first deck, are as follows.
1. Form Factor: Like other playing cards, hanafuda come in many different shapes, sizes, and materials. Some of these form factors might be:
A. Traditional construction, backpasted.
B. "Cut off" cardboard, no backing paper.
C. Thick plastic hwatu or hwatu-style decks, similar in size to the previous two options.
D. Thin paper or plastic "Western-style" cards, of varying sizes.
2. Pattern/Artwork: There are hundreds of different hanafuda designs out there, of all different styles. Some have simple, bare-bones art, and some have your favorite anime characters on them, while others may form lush tetraptych paintings when the cards in a suit are properly aligned. For gameplay's sake, the traditional designs are probably the easiest to interpret, but you'll also get more enjoyment out of a deck you love to look at and show off.

# Gameplay
## 1. What is the best hanafuda game for beginners?
There are probably two really good answers for this question:
1. [Bakappana](/en/hanafuda/games/bakappana) is a simple fishing-type game for 2-4 players whose gameplay is generalizable to a wide variety of other [hanafuda games](/en/hanafuda/games). Its straightforward scoring is easy to learn and may offer newcomers an opportunity to learn the different categories of cards. Its greatest downside is one its upsides - its relative lack of depth. Once you've mastered this game, you'll probably want to mix it up with some more complex games, which allow for more thoughtful play.
2. [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi) is probably the most popular hanafuda game, which makes it quite accessible. For one, there are more koi-koi video games and applications than there are for any other hanafuda game, making it easy to learn and play on one's own. And, if you encounter another hanafuda enthusiast, whether in person or online, chances are that they will know how to play koi-koi, allowing you the most opportunities to play hanafuda with others. That said, it's more complex and more difficult to master than bakappana.
## 2. My friend and I don't play koi-koi the same way. Why?

## 3. My hand doesn't have any matches with the board. What are my options?

## 4. What happens if I play a card with multiple matches on the board?

## 5. This game is complicated. Is there a printable reference somewhere?

## 6. I'm tired of Koi-Koi; what else can I do with Hanafuda?
Hanafuda make up an "open system" so to speak; that is, the cards can be used to play a practically infinite number of games, just like Western playing cards. For a non-exhaustive list of hanafuda games, see [Hanafuda Games](/en/hanafuda/games).
