This page contains answers to some common questions related to [Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) and [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi).
# Decks
## 1. What is this white card for?
The white card [白札 - しろふだ, *shirofuda*] included in many decks has a few uses:
1. For games such as [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi) with more than 3 players that require some to drop out each round, the white card can be shuffled with the deck to allow 7 people to participate in the game. In this case, the player dealt the white card is automatically required to drop out, and the other 6 cards in their hand become the field for the match.
2. In the case that another card in the deck becomes lost, which would make the deck unsuitable to play most games, the white card can be used to replace the missing card. When this is the case, the necessary details of the missing card are often drawn on the blank card.
3.  In some decks, especially those by Nintendo, the white card is not completely blank, but has a number and/or some kanji printed on it. The number or kanji may sometimes be helpful in dating a deck; starting in the early 2000s, Nintendo began printing the date on these cards, in YYMMDD format. Older decks often have 5- or 6-digit numbers as well, but it is less clear whether or how these can be interpreted as dates.
