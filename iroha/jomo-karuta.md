Jōmō Karuta [上毛かるた] is a type of [Iroha Karuta](/en/iroha) that consists of 88 cards (44 Yomi-fuda and 44 Tori-fuda) whose theme centers around Gunma Prefecture in Japan and its people, places, and history.

The name, Jōmō, is an old name for Gunma.

# History
In 1946, Masahiko Urano, a native of Gunma, returned to his hometown from Manchukuo (present day Manchuria in China) to help the people there who were affected by World War II. Under orders of The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, schools had stopped teaching geography and history. Urano, who loved Gunma dearly, wanted the children to take pride in their local history and culture.

On July 15 of that year, Urano met Seiki Suda, a Christian evangelist from Annaka, at a repatriation convention in Maebashi City. Together, Urano and Suda came up with the idea of promoting Gunma's history and culture through the game of karuta.

On January 11, 1947, The local newspaper, *Jōmō Shimbun*, ran an ad announcing the concept and asked for submissions for possible card ideas. 44 phrases were selected by an editorial committee consisting of 18 local historians and cultural figures. The illustrated cards were commissioned to the artist Tatsuo Omi, and the commentary on the back of the Yomi-fuda to the historical researcher Kiyoyasu Maruyama.

The [first edition](https://carta.media.gunma-u.ac.jp/gunma/jomo_s22/index.html) of Jōmō Karuta was released within the year, which sold 12,000 copies. Since then, the set was republished several times with updated information and new artwork.

The following year, in 1948, the first annual Jōmō Karuta competition was held.

## List of Phrases
Note that among the 44 phrases, only the phrase on the "chi" Yomi-fuda changes slightly depending on the year of publication. That is because it is representative of the population of Gunma, so as the number of people living in the prefecture changes, so does the number shown on the card. Fans of Jōmō karuta are able to guess the age of a person from Gunma prefecture based on the version of the "chi" phrase one has memorized.

# Jōmō Karuta Competition
Jōmō Karuta Competition is a tournament held every year in Gunma prefecture since 1948, one year after Jōmō Karuta was published.

Preliminaries take place in January, encouraging local children to take advantage of winter vacation to practice. Then the final competition is held in February.

The game could be played by two players against each other, or two teams each having three players.

## 1 versus 1
- The **reader** takes the deck of Yomi-fuda, and the **referee**, who is in charge of judging which player took the Tori-fuda first, watches over the match. 
- Players must choose who shuffles the deck by rock-paper-scissors. The winner shuffles the deck of Tori-fuda and splits it into two piles of 22 Tori-fuda each. The loser chooses which pile to take, and the winner takes the other pile.
- Each player arranges the cards in their "territory". The opposing territories must be **3 cm apart from each other**, and **20 cm away from the players** *(this 20 cm distance is usually marked with a line, and is supposedly where the player's kneecaps are positioned, and the hands of each player must be beside the kneecaps whenever they are ready to strike the Tori-fuda)*. The territory should be composed of 3 rows of Torifuda, spaced 1 cm apart. The width of each row is not specified; you must arrange the cards in each row evenly (7 cards in any two rows, 8 cards in the remaining one row), in any order you prefer.
- The referee will give a signal 3 minutes before starting the match. Players are free to arrange the Tori-fuda and memorize their positions at this time. The referee will give another signal 1 minute before starting the match, and afterward, players are not allowed to touch the Tori-fuda on the floor.
- The reader announces the beginning of the match by reciting the phrase on the 'tsu' card:
**つる舞う形の群馬県**
[*Tsuru mau katachi no Gunma-ken*, "Shaped like a flying crane, Gunma Prefecture"]
- The reader then repeats the recited phrase. At this point, the players should be ready to touch the Tori-fuda because the reader will read the first Yomi-fuda next.
- The reader then reads the first Yomi-fuda in a high toned voice. As the reader does so, players must **touch the corresponding Tori-fuda**. The **first** player to do so **takes the Tori-fuda**.

> Players may touch the correct Tori-fuda whether it is on their own territory or their opponent's.
{.is-info}

> "Touching" the Tori-fuda could mean: Simply touching it, swiping it, flipping it, or grabbing it. This does not include pushing the Tori-fuda away with a different Tori-fuda.
{.is-info}

> Unlike in [Kyogi Karuta](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu/competitive-karuta), **you may not touch *any* Tori-fuda that isn't the correct Tori-fuda**. If you do, then it is counted as a *fault*. *(If you commit a fault, then as a penalty, you must give 1 of your taken Tori-fuda to your opponent, who places it among their taken Tori-fuda.)*
{.is-warning}

> You may only touch Tori-fuda **using one hand only**, so it is preferable to use your dominant hand. The other hand that is not used **cannot trespass the line** 20 cm away from your territory.
{.is-warning}
- After taking the correct Tori-fuda, players are given a short period of time to put back into position the Tori-fuda that have been pushed away, if there are any.
- The reader then reads the Yomi-fuda again, but in a lower toned voice. Again, at this point, the players should be ready to touch the Tori-fuda because afterward, the reader will read the next Yomi-fuda.
> As the reader reads a phrase for the second time (including the opening phrase), players must put their hands beside their kneecaps, and **may not put any of their hand(s)/arm(s) on their lap**.
{.is-warning}
- The reader then proceeds to read the next Yomi-fuda, and the players must touch the correct Tori-fuda. Then the reader reads the Yomi-fuda again. This process is repeated throughout the entire stack of Yomi-fuda.
- When only 2 Tori-fuda are left on the floor, they are **repositioned side by side, and 30 cm apart from each other**. The reader reads one of the two remaining Yomi-fuda, and players must touch the correct Tori-fuda as normal. 
- However, **as soon as the reader finishes reading** the Yomi-fuda for the **second time**, players then race to **touch the final remaining card** (*the final Yomi-fuda is not read*). The first to do so takes the final card, and the game ends.
- The player with the most taken Tori-fuda wins. In the event of a tie, the player who took the "tsu" card wins.

## 3 versus 3
The game is mostly the same as 1 versus 1, except for some additional rules:
- Only the players in the middle participate in rock-paper-scissors.
- Each territory should be composed of 2 rows of Torifuda, spaced 1 cm apart.  The cards are distributed between teammates evenly (7 cards to any two teammates, 8 cards to the remaining teammate). Each teammate has its own territory (the spacing between teammates' territories are not specified), and the cards are distributed evenly between two rows (i.e. each row must contain only 3 or 4 cards). The cards may be arranged in any order they prefer.
- When only 2 Tori-fuda are left on the floor, they are **repositioned side by side, and 30 cm apart from each other**. At this point, only the middle players participate in taking the remaining Tori-fuda.
- Each taken Tori-fuda is worth 1 point. The team with most points wins. However, **there are certain dekiyaku which may give additional points** to a team:

|Name|Points|Composition|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Oya-fuda**|10|tsu, chi, ke (Gunma's topography, population, and prefectural government building)|
|**Goshi-fuda**|20|o, ka, me, ki, ke (The five biggest cities of Gunma prefecture)|
|**Sanyama-fuda**|10|su, mo, no (The three famous mountains of Gunma prefecture)|

- Elementary school players may only use the Goshi-fuda and Sanyama-fuda dekiyaku. Junior high-school players may use all 3 dekiyaku.
