Character Iroha Karuta [キャラクターいろはかるた] are a type of [Iroha Karuta](/en/iroha) that generally feature characters and imagery from popular television, manga, or video game franchises. Alternatively, they may follow some other theme, often specific to a particular region or hobby.

Depending on the set illustrations on the Torifuda, as well as the writings on the Yomifuda, are all based on the characters and imagery from the intellectual property being featured. Nevertheless, the gameplay of Iroha Karuta remains the same.

Unlike [Character Hanafuda](/en/hanafuda/character), which are usually regarded as collectibles or collector's items, Character Iroha Karuta are usually regarded as toys and could be bought usually cheaply, with a few exceptions.
