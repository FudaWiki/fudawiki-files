Edo Iroha Karuta [江戸いろはかるた] is a type of Iroha Karuta that originated in Edo (now Tokyo, Japan). It consists of 96 cards (48 Yomi-fuda and 48 Tori-fuda) whose theme centers around different proverbs and sayings. 

It is also called Inubō karuta [犬棒かるた, 'dog stick karuta'], after the proverb, "***Inu** mo arukeba **bō** ni ataru*".
