Menko (めんこ, 面子), is a Japanese traditional card game played by two or more players, where each player throws a card onto another card on the ground in hopes of flipping it.

# History of Menko
## Edo period: Clay Menko
In the Edo period (1603-1867), a game called "Ana-ichi" (one hole) was played. Children threw shells, nuts, coins, molded clay, or other objects into a small hole dug in the ground, and whoever manages to have their object caught in the hole wins.

During the Tempo era (1831-1835), the use of menko made out of molded clay became popular as a tool for playing "Ana-ichi". 

There are different types of clay menko, according to their shape:
- Men'uchi/Menchou/Menchi (面打)
- Keshi-men (芥子面)
- Mengata (面摸)

The game was still played by children until the mid-Meiji era (1868-1912), when the name of the game was changed to "Menko".

## Meiji Era: Lead Menko
The popularity of using molded clay for playing menko continued during the Meiji era until its decline with the introduction of menko made of lead during the 1870's. 

Garagara Senbei, a snack that has existed since the Edo period, was originally filled with clay menko and played with in a manner similar to playing "Ogojiki" (a game that uses flat marbles). The clay menko were then replaced with lead menko, and at first they were played with in the same way as "Ogojiki". However, eventually, a method of playing called "Okoshi" became common, which suited the lead material the menko were made of.
