**Kachi-Kachi** is a Kabufuda game for 2-8 players in which players bet on the value of their dealt cards across multiple rounds, similar to most poker games. Optional rules add multiple special hands and unique cards for an increased element of luck. 

# Equipment
**Kachi-Kachi** is played using a *half deck* of *Kabufuda* cards, consisting of only two sets of the cards 1-10.

>If playing with the *special cards* variant rule, add the red One and the marked Four to the deck.

Additionally, it is recommended to use chips or other small counters to keep track of bets and players' scores.

# Gameplay
For the initial hand, determine the dealer using a method of your choice. For subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand will deal the following hand. In the event of a draw, the dealer of the drawn hand will deal the following hand.

Before the game starts, determine the *ante*, the *minimum bet size* a player can make and the *maximum amount of points* a player is able to wager in any one hand.

Each player then *antes* the agreed amount, and the dealer deals each player two cards.
## Betting Rounds
The dealer begins the hand with the option to make an opening bet equal to or greater than the *minimum bet size* or fold their hand. Continuing clockwise, each player then has the option to match the dealer's bet or fold their hand.

>If the dealer folds, the next player then has the option to make an opening bet or fold following the same rules. If all players except one fold, the last remaining player collects the pot without proceeding to *showdown*.

The dealer (or closest remaining player in order) then begins a second betting round, with the same options as the first. Play continues in the same way.

A third and final betting round follows, in the same way as the previous two. After this rounds, all remaining players proceed to *showdown*.

## Showdown
Starting with the dealer (or closest player in order), each player reveals their cards. Hands are evaluated according to the *Hand Rankings* chart below. The winner of the hand collects the pot and becomes the dealer for the next hand. The winner of the hand also does not place an *ante* for the following hand. 

>In the case of a draw, the pot for the hand carries over to the next hand, and the dealer for the drawn hand deals the following hand. All players *ante* as normal for that hand.
