**Kachi-Kachi** is a Kabufuda game for 2-8 players in which players bet on the value of their dealt cards across multiple rounds, similar to most poker games. Optional rules add multiple special hands and unique cards for an increased element of luck. 

# Equipment
**Kachi-Kachi** is played using a *half deck* of *Kabufuda* cards, consisting of only two sets of the cards 1-10, including the red One and the marked Four.

>If desired, add an extra One and an extra Ten to the deck for a greater chance at forming special hands.

Additionally, it is recommended to use chips or other small counters to keep track of bets and players' scores.

# Gameplay
For the initial hand, determine the dealer using a method of your choice. For subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand will deal the following hand. In the event of a draw, the dealer of the drawn hand will deal the following hand.

Before the game starts, determine the *ante*, the *minimum bet size* a player can make and the *maximum amount of points* a player is able to wager in any one hand.

Each player then *antes* the agreed amount, and the dealer deals each player two cards.
## Betting Rounds
The dealer begins the hand with the option to make an opening bet equal to or greater than the *minimum bet size* or fold their hand. Continuing clockwise, each player then has the option to match the dealer's bet or fold their hand.

>If the dealer folds, the next player then has the option to make an opening bet or fold following the same rules. If all players except one fold, the last remaining player collects the pot without proceeding to *showdown*.

The dealer (or closest remaining player in order) then begins a second betting round, with the same options as the first. Play continues in the same way.

A third and final betting round follows, in the same way as the previous two. After this rounds, all remaining players proceed to *showdown*.

## Showdown
Starting with the dealer (or closest player in order), each player reveals their cards. Hands are evaluated according to the *Hand Rankings* chart below. The winner of the hand collects the pot and becomes the dealer for the next hand. The winner of the hand also does not place an *ante* for the following hand. 

>In the case of a draw, the pot for the hand carries over to the next hand, and the dealer for the drawn hand deals the following hand. All players *ante* as normal for that hand. 
{.is-info}
## Hand Rankings
1. All pairs from a pair of Tens to a pair of Sixes, with higher pairs beating lower pairs.
2. A One and a Four (*shippin*)
3. The remaining pair hands, from a pair of Fives to a pair of Ones, with higher pairs beating lower hands. 
4. One and Ten
5. One and Nine
6. One and Six
7. One and Five

Finally, score remaining combinations according to their total in Oicho-Kabu, with higher totals beating lower totals. 
# Special Rules


## Zero Hand
At any point, if the value of the cards in your hand equals zero (during any betting round or during showdown), you may reveal your hand and draw the top card of the deck, then combine it with one of your revealed cards to form a new two-card hand. If the drawn card is a Ten, you can draw another card and combine it with one of the three cards to form a new two-card hand. 

>You cannot claim a Zero Hand if your hand consists of a One and Nine, a pair of Tens, or a pair of Fives, as these are higher-ranking Kachi-Kachi hands and as such not scored as Oicho-Kabu hands.

## Tips
After *showdown*, you can reveal certain combinations of cards to collect bonus payments from all other players at the table, called *tips*. These hands and their accompanying payments are as follows.

1. Pair of Tens: Collect 10 points from each player. If playing with three Tens in the deck, you can reveal the top card of the deck and collect an additional 10 points from each player if that card is a Ten. 
2. The red One and the marked Four: Collect 5 points from each player.
3. A pair of Ones including the red One: Collect 5 points from each player. If you reveal this hand, you can reveal the top card of the deck and collect an additional 10 points from each player if that card is a One. 

>If you form a tip-earning hand with the card(s) drawn from claiming a Zero Hand, reveal those cards collect payment from them now as well.
