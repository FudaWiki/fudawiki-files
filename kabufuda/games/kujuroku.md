Kujuroku [九十六 - くじゅろく, lit. “Ninety-six”] is a type of fishing game that was attested to be played in the Akehama Town, in Ehime Prefecture of Japan.

The name comes from the par score of the game: 96 points.

It was played using Daini, which is a 40-card deck with only 1 suit: Coins. It bears a similar structure to [Kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), except that Daini has three special cards (1, 3, and 4) while Kabufuda only has two (1 and 4).

The game shares the same gameplay as [Hana-Awase](/en/hanafuda/games/hana-awase), and is attested to be played by **4 people**, with 3 people participating in each round at once. *(Of course, it is possible to play the game with 3 players only)*

# Card Names
| NAME | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| I-tsun | Special "1" |
| I-shi | Special "4" |
| Bakatsun | Normal "1" |
| Bakashi  | Normal "4" |
| Doh  | "10" |

# Equipment
40 cards plus the Oni-fuda (demon card) of the Daini deck are used, for a total of 41 cards. 

> Since the special "3" is not treated differently in this game, you may also use a Kabufuda deck, and add the blank card as the wild card.
{.is-warning}

> You may also use a Hanafuda deck if you are familiar with the month sequence of the cards.
{.is-warning}

Pieces of paper called **"Slips"** may be useful for keeping track of the players' winnings.





# Game Setup
## Choosing the Dealer
There is no attested method for choosing a dealer, so you may use whichever method suits you.

## Dealing the Initial Cards
6 cards are dealt to each player, and 6 cards face-up to the table. The remainder of the deck is placed face-down to form the draw pile.

- If the Oni-fuda is dealt on the field, dealer takes it and one card on the field of the dealer’s choice into their capture pile.

- If there are 3 cards of the same month on the field, the dealer takes 2 of those 3 cards and puts them in their capture pile.

- If 4 cards of the same number are dealt to the table, then a **misdeal** is declared (since these 4 cards are impossible to capture); In this case, the cards are thrown in, shuffled again, and re-dealt.


## Join-in/Drop-out Phase
> This rule has not been attested; it is only included as an optional rule.
{.is-warning}

Each player checks the cards dealt to them and, starting from the dealer counter-clockwise, declares whether to participate in the round ("join-in"), or wait until the next round ("drop-out").

Once a player decides to "drop-out", the remaining three players must participate in the round.

When 3 players have decided to join-in, the remaining player will automatically be unable to participate in the round ("forced-out").

> Whether or not penalties for dropping out, and/or compensations for the forced-out player are implemented should probably be agreed upon as a house rule.
{.is-warning}

The player who dropped out or is forced out puts his/her cards back into the draw pile and shuffles it.

# Gameplay
The core gameplay is identical to Hana-awase, except that instead of matching flowers, **numbers/courts** are being matched instead.

The game ends when all players run out of cards in hand.

> Since there are a total of 18 cards in all players’ hands and only 17 cards on the draw pile, the last player to play a card from their hand no longer draws a card from the draw pile.
{.is-info}

## Wild Card
The Oni-fuda is considered a wild card in the game. It can be used to capture any card on the field, regardless of number.

If dealt on the field, dealer takes it and one card on the field of the dealer’s choice into their capture pile.

If a player has it in hand, they may use it during any of their turns. However, it is not allowed to discard it and use the drawn card to capture the wild card.

If it was drawn from the draw pile, it must be used to capture a card on the field.

> It is not explained what happens if the field is empty and there is no choice but to discard the card on the field. **(NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)**
{.is-warning}

# Scoring
Each player's total card points are then counted.

## Card Points
- **The Oni-fuda** is the highest scoring, worth **12 points**.
- **The "1"s, the "2"s, and the "10"s** are worth **10 points** each. 
- **Other cards** are worth points **equal to their number**.


The total card points in the deck is 300.

## Yaku
In addition to the usual card point scoring, each player who forms a yaku receives additional points from the other 2 participating players.

| NAME OF YAKU | Composition | Value (in points) |
|:------|:---|:---|
| **Shi Yaku** | Four "4"s | 4 |
| **San Yaku** | Four "3"s | 6 |
| **Danjou** | Oni-fuda + I-tsun + I-shi | 8 |
| **Shi-Dan**  | Four "4"s + Oni-fuda | 12 |
| **Shi-Dan-San**  | Four "4"s + Oni-fuda + Four "3"s | 18 |

The total score of a player in a round is as follows:
`Player's Score = Total card points + (Value of Yaku formed x 2) - Value of Other Player's Yaku`

**The player with the highest score becomes the dealer for the next round.**

# Winnings Table
Depending on the player's score, the player either wins or loses slips.

The minimum score a player must reach during a round is **96 points**. Any score below 96 causes the player to lose slips.

| SCORE | Slips won |
|:------|:---|
| **116 and above** | +3 | 
| **106-115** | +2 | 
| **96-105** | +1 | 
| **86-95**  | -1 | 
| **76-85**  | -2 | 
| **75 and below**  | -3 |
