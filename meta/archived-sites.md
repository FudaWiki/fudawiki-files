# Archived Sites

Below are links to sites that are defunct and now only accessible via the Internet Archive; they are hard to find otherwise.

* [The website of 石見博昭 (Hiroaki Ishimi)](https://web.archive.org/web/20181111085619/http://www.geocities.jp:80/xmbwq497/h-menu.html), featuring a lot of information about different varieties of Hanafuda and rules. (In Japanese.)
