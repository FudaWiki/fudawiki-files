Because of the decreasing importance of suits in specific Japanese games played using [Tensho Karuta](/en/tensho) and [Mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), **One-suited [karuta](/en/karuta) decks** were subsequently developed. This innovation helped players avoid confusing the cards due to the huge variation of illustrations in Mekurifuda decks.
 
There were two main classifications of these one-suited decks: 
- **Kabu Karuta**, which use the suit of Clubs, and
- **Mame Karuta**, which use the suit of Coins.

Depending on the pattern, the deck may contain either 40 or 48 cards.

Just like the Mekurifuda, they were created to get around the ban on cards bearing Portuguese playing card designs, by transforming the usual courts and dragons into abstract shapes or strokes. 

These cards in particular, were used for playing simpler Japanese card games, usually betting games. However, they were not exclusively used for such games only; Daini, for example, is attested to be used for playing [Kujuroku](/en/kabufuda/games/kujuroku), a fishing game.

For a list of games played using these cards, see [Mekurifuda Games](/en/mekurifuda/games).

# Kabu Karuta
Kabu Karuta [かぶかるた] are card decks that consist of 4 copies of the suit of **Clubs** for every number in the deck.

The name may come from [Kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), which is the most popular pattern in this category, due to the other decks' similarity in appearance with Kabufuda.

It may also refer to the fact that the decks were designed for playing Kabu [カブ] games, which were showdown or banking games that use the method of taking the ones digit of the sum of the numbers in a set of cards to determine it's strength, with 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest.
