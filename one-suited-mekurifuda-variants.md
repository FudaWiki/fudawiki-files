Because of the decreasing importance of suits in Japanese games played using Tensho Karuta and [Mekurifuda](/en/mekurifuda), **One-suited decks** were subsequently developed.

There were two main classifications of these one-suited decks: 
- **Kabu Karuta**, which use the suit of Clubs, and
- **Meme Karuta**, which use the suit of Coins.

Depending on the pattern, the deck may contain either 40 or 48 cards.

Just like the Mekurifuda, they were created to get around the ban on cards bearing Portuguese playing card designs, by transforming the usual courts and dragons into abstract shapes or strokes. 

These cards in particular, were used for playing simpler Japanese card games, usually betting games.

The name comes from the game [Mekuri](/en/mekurifuda/games/mekuri), which was originally played using Tensho Karuta. However, these cards are not strictly used for Mekuri games only.

For a list of games played using these cards, see [Mekurifuda Games](/en/mekurifuda/games).

# Kabu Karuta
Kabu Karuta [かぶかるた] are card decks that consist of 4 copies of the suit of **Clubs** for every number in the deck.

The name may come from [Kabufuda](/en/kabufuda), which is the most popular pattern in this category, due to the other decks' similarity in appearance with Kabufuda.

It may also refer to the fact that the decks were designed for playing Kabu [カブ] games, which were showdown or banking games that use the method of taking the ones digit of the sum of the numbers in a set of cards to determine it's strength, with 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest.

## Kinds of Kabu Karuta

|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
|**Kabufuda**|-|40|Consists of 4 copies of the numbers 1 to 10, with a special overprinted 1 and 4.</br>The only court card "10" looks like a two-way Jack holding a very short sword, but its body is based on the Queen of Clubs of a western playing card deck.|
|**Kinseizan**|-|48|Looks like Kabufuda, with a few differences:</br>There are 3 court cards (10, 11, 12), whose designs look more like the 2 of coins, the horse of clubs, and the king of clubs in a mekurifuda deck.</br>All 1, 2, 10, 11, and 12 cards are overprinted. Special 4 is overprinted like Kabufuda, while Special 1 has a Paulownia and Cloud overprint.</br>Comes with Onifuda.|

# Mame Karuta
Mame Karuta [まめカルタ] are card decks that consist of 4 copies of the suit of **Coins** for every number in the deck.

The name refers to the round shape of the pips on the cards,which resemble beans [まめ, *mame*].
