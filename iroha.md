Iroha Karuta (いろはかるた, 'alphabet cards') is an [Uta-garuta](/en/uta-garuta) derivative designed to be played by children in order to facilitate learning the Japanese *kana* (syllables).

It is named after the old way of ordering Japanese *kana*, which was [based on an old poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha).

As an Uta-garuta derivative, it shares the exact same gameplay as [Hyakunin Isshu](/en/uta-garuta/ogura-hyakunin-isshu) or other types of Uta-garuta. However, the format of the cards makes the game easier for children to play, without having to memorize any poems beforehand.

# The Cards
As with many Uta-garuta sets, a set of Iroha Karuta contains two types of cards: **Yomifuda** (読み札, "reading cards") and **Torifuda** (取り札, "grabbing cards").

In Iroha Karuta, There are about 46 to 48 Yomifuda, and a corresponding number of Torifuda, for a total of 92 to 96 cards per set. The variation in number of cards is due to some archaic characters being deleted or replaced over time.

Each **Yomifuda** contains a writing. Traditionally, this writing is a **proverb**, but it could be a random saying or description, depending on the Iroha karuta set being used.

Each corresponding **Torifuda** contains **an illustration related to the writing on the Torifuda, as well as a circle with the first syllable of the writing, written in hiragana**.

## Traditional Iroha Karuta Sets
All of these sets feature proverbs, but the contents vary per set. The sets are:
- **Edo Iroha Karuta** - From Edo (now Tokyo). It is the most widely used set.
- **Kamigata Iroha Karuta** - From Kamigata region (Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe). It is the oldest of the three sets.
- **Owari Iroha Karuta** - From Owari province. It is the youngest of the three sets.

For a list of proverbs see [Iroha Karuta Proverbs](/en/iroha/proverbs).

## Other Iroha Karuta Sets
- **Obake Karuta** (お化けかるた, 'monster cards') is a type of Iroha Karuta that is themed around various monsters from Japanese folklore. It can be considered the predecessor of Character Iroha Karuta.
- **Hougen Karuta** (方言かるた, 'regional dialect cards') is a type of Iroha Karuta whose Yomifuda include phrases of a Japanese regional dialect.
- **Kyodo Karuta** (郷土かるたかるた, 'regional history cards') is a type of Iroha Karuta that is themed around local events, specialties, and historical sites of a region in Japan. An example is **Jōmō Karuta** (上毛かるた), which is themed around Gunma prefecture, and is first published in 1947.
- **Character Iroha Karuta** is a type of Iroha Karuta that is themed around an intellectual property, such as Anime, Tokusatsu, Video game, etc.
- **Campaign Iroha Karuta** is a type of Iroha Karuta that is themed around a program, campaign, or slogan, promoted usually by a Government Department.

# General Premise of the Game
The game is played with **1 person reading the Yomifuda** (hereafter refered to as the **"reader"**), and player(s) competing in the game. 

> Only the players compete in the game. The reader's role is to read the Yomifuda only.
{.is-warning}

Torifuda are laid on the floor. As the reader reads a poem on the Yomifuda, the player(s) must search on the floor the corresponding Torifuda in which the latter half of the poem is written, as quickly as possible.

The objective is to grab as many Torifuda in the game as possible.



# Methods of Playing
## Scatter and Pick up (散らし取り - *Chirashi-Dori*)
This is one of the traditional ways of playing the game, and can be played by any number of players.

Each player plays only for themselves, and the objective is to be the player to grab the most Torifuda.

The game goes as follows:
- Hand the Yomifuda deck to the reader.
- Shuffle the Torifuda deck, and then scatter them on the floor face-up so that everybody can see each card. Ideally the cards are scattered in a circle such that every player has an equal chance to grab every card on the floor.

> You may also line the Torifuda neatly in a grid, if 1 or 2 players are playing.
{.is-info}

- Each player sits around the scattered Tori-fuda.
- The reader draws a Yomifuda from the deck and starts reading it out loud. Players must recognize the **first syllable** being read as soon as possible, and race to find and grab the corresponding Torifuda.
- The first player to grab the correct Torifuda takes the Torifuda.
- After the Torifuda is taken, the reader proceeds to draw and read the next Yomifuda.
- The game continues until all Yomifuda are read and all Torifuda are taken. 
- Players count the Torifuda they have taken. The player with the most Torifuda wins the game.

## Jomo Karuta Competition
Every year, Gunma prefecture holds a Jomo Karuta competition, which was started in 1948, one year after it was published.

The game could be played by two players against each other, or two teams each having three players.

### 1 versus 1
- The reader takes the deck of Yomi-fuda, and the referee is in charge of any 
- Plays must choose the dealer by rock-paper-scissors. The winner shuffles the deck of Tori-fuda and splits it into two piles of 22 Tori-fuda each. The loser chooses which pile to take, and the winner takes the other pile.
- Each player arranges the cards in their "territory". The opposing territories must be 3 cm apart. The territory should be composed of 3 rows of Torifuda, spaced 1 cm apart. The width of each row is not specified; you must arrange the cards in each row evenly (7 cards in any two rows, 8 cards in the remaining one row), in any order you prefer.
